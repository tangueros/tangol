  %li
    %a{:href => "#FAQ-Plaintext"}

///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ FAQ Change Options
%a{:name => "FAQ-ChangeOptions"}>
.question
  How do I unsubscribe, check my
  subscription or change my list options 
  or subscriptions?
.answer
  Here are the step-by-step instructions:
  %ol
    %li
      Go to the
      %a{:href => "http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-l"}
        Tango-L
      administrative page at
      %a{:href => "http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-l"}
        http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-l
      (and/or the
      %a{:href => "http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-a"} 
        Tango-A
      administrative page at
      %a{:href => "http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-a"}
        http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-a
      , depending on which list(s) 
      you want to check or modify your subscription for.
    %li
      At the bottom of the page, enter the email address 
      under which you are
      subscribed and click on the "Unsubscribe or Edit Options" 
      button at the bottom of the page. 
      (If you cannot remember the email address under 
      which you are subscribed, see the FAQ article on
      %a{:href => "#FAQ-Unsubscribe"} Difficulties in Unsubscribing
      .)
    %li
      On the next page you will be prompted for your password. 
      If you don't remember it, you can click on the 
      "Password Reminder" button and it will be
      emailed to you at the address you specified 
      (assuming that that address is, in
      fact, subscribed to the list). 
      If you can no longer receive email at that
      email address, see the FAQ article on
      %a{:href => "#FAQ-Unsubscribe"} Difficulties in Unsubscribing
      .
    %li
      Once you are successfully logged in, you can 
      check your options,
      unsubscribe, change to or from the digest mode, 
      and other fun options if you
      are into that sort of thing. 
      Most of the options can be changed globally,
      i.e., you can specify them to apply to both 
      Tango-L and Tango-A (and any other
      lists at mit.edu that you are subscribed to --
      not likely unless you are an MIT
      student or affiliate).


///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ FAQ Unsubscribe
%a{:name => "FAQ-Unsubscribe"}
.question
  I am trying to unsubscribe from the list following 
  all the instructions and I can't. Get me off!
.answer
  If you followed all the
  %a{:href => "#FAQ-ChangeOptions"} instructions for unsubscribing above
  , and still cannot log in to your account, 
  search your old email for an email with subject "
  %b mit.edu mailing list memberships reminder
  \" sent from " 
  %b mailman-owner [@] mit.edu
  \".  
  This will have a list of all the lists you are 
  subscribed to at mit.edu, the email address with 
  which you are subscribed, and the password 
  associated with each subscription. 
  This should allow you to log on and unsubscribe in the
  %a{:href => "#FAQ-ChangeOptions"} previous FAQ entry
  .
  %p
    If you cannot find this email, or deleted it, 
    send an email to tango-L-owner@mit.edu with
    %i (a)
    your full name,
    %i (b)
    the list(s) you wish to be unsubscribed from,
    %i (c)
    all possible email addresses or
    variants under which you could have been subscribed,
    %i (d)
    a forwarded email with headers of mail you are 
    receiving from each list from which you wish
    to be unsubscribed, and the list administrator will 
    take care of it for you.


///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ FAQ Change Email
%a{:name => "FAQ-ChangeEmail"}>
.question
  I have a new email address and I want to change it 
  in the list. How can I do it?
.answer
  Log on to your subscription page for changing your 
  options following the
  %a{:href => "#FAQ-ChangeOptions"} steps described above
  . The very first section allows you to change your 
  email address, and includes a checkbox to apply 
  that change to all other lists at mit.edu that 
  you happen to be subscribed to. 
  This is much better than unsubscribing and 
  resubscribing, as
  %i (a)
  it is much faster and
  %i (b)
  it preserves all your settings (digest,
  topics for Tango-A, etc.).


///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ FAQ Plaintext
%a{:name => "FAQ-Plaintext"}>
.question
  How do I send mail in "plaintext" (whatever that is) 
  as opposed to HTML (whatever
  %i that
  is)?
.answer
  The Tango-L and Tango-A lists discourage the use of HTML or
  formatted email (with colours, bold text, etc.) so as
  %i (a)
  to emphasize the content and not the excessive use of 
  typography or visual hyperbole and
  %i (b)
  to reduce the size of digests, archives and postings 
  in general, and for
  better compatibility with mailers. 
  Unfortunately, most contemporary mailers
  default to formatted or HTML mail composition. 
  You have to find the option in
  your mail sending program to turn off formatting 
  (many mail programs allow you
  the option of setting the preference of individual 
  entries in your address-book
  to "formatted" "unformatted" mail, so set up the 
  Tango-L and Tango-A posting
  addresses in your address-book with those preferences, 
  or set it globally to "plaintext."
  %p
    There is a more detailed discussion of this subject, along with detailed
    instructions on how to do this for seemingly every possible mailer out there, at
    %a{:href => "http://www.expita.com/nomime.html", :target => "_blank"}>
      http://www.expita.com/nomime.html
    . Here are our instructions for selected mailers (if you use a different one and
    would like to add instructions for your mailer to help other users who use that
    mailer, please email these instructions to tango-L-owner@mit.edu  and they
    will be incorporated here):
  %p
    %i
      %b Google Mail Beta:
    On the Compose page, if a formatting bar
    (font selections, etc.) appears below the Subject: 
    field, click on "« Plain text". (When it shows 
    "Rich formatting »", you are correctly in 
    "Plain Text" mode.)
  %p
    %i
      %b Mozilla Thunderbird 2.0:
    Tools &gt; Account Settings &gt; Composition
    \&amp; Addressing. Uncheck the box that says, 
    "Compose messages in HTML Format."
    Alternatively, go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; 
    Composition &gt; General &gt; Send Options &gt;
    Plain Text Domains. Under Text Format, select the 
    option, "Convert the message to Plain Text."
  %p
    %i 
      %b Netscape Mail 7.1:
    Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Mail and
    Newsgroups &gt; Send Format. 
    Select "Convert the message to plain text" and under
    "Plain Text Domains," add
    %b mit.edu
    .
  %p
    %i 
      %b Yahoo Mail (original):
    In mail window, click Options (upper
    right) &gt; General Preferences (under Management) &gt; Select "Compose Messages as
    plain text" (under Composing E-mail). Click Save.
  %p
    %i
      %b Yahoo Mail Beta or New:
    In mail compose window, if a formatting
    bar (font selections, etc.) are shown below the Subject: field, click on "Plain
    Text" to the right of the Subject: field. When it shows "Rich Text" to the right
    of the Subject: field, you are correctly in "Plain Text" mode.


///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ FAQ TOPICS
%a{:name => "FAQ-Topics"}>
.question
  What are the "geographical prefix" letters
  like "NA-E:" that appear in the Subject of Tango-A postings and why do I need
  them?
.answer
  Every posting to Tango-A (this doesn't apply to Tango-L)
  %i must
  be preceded with a prefix (SA:, NA-E:, NA-C:, NA-W:, EU-W:, EU-E:, AASP: or MISC:)
  that indicates the part of the world that 
  the event being announced is being held. 
  (This is sometimes referred to as a "Topic" as well.) 
  If this is not included, the posting will likely 
  not be distributed to the majority of members
  on the list. 
  The format of this prefix must be exactly as 
  written above (in
  upper case followed by a colon and a space) 
  and then the subject. 
  And it must be one of the above list -- you 
  cannot invent your own prefix even if 
  you think it makes more sense. 
  See the
  %a{:href => "tango-A-rules.htm#Topics"} Topics section at the Tango-A rules page
  for further details, including the table that 
  maps the prefix to the relevant
  area of the world, if you plan to or are 
  trying to post to Tango-A.
  

///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ FAQ NOT ALLOWED
%a{:name => "FAQ-NotAllowed"}>
.question
  I tried to send a message to the list and got a automatic reply saying that I
  am not allowed to post to the list! Why is that? I've been a member of the list
  for ages!
.answer
  The lists only permit postings from those who
  are members of the list. 
  If you are a member of the list, the mostly 
  likely explanation for the
  rejection is that you are trying to post from a 
  different email address than the
  one under which you are subscribed. 
  Perhaps your university or company changed
  the way your email looks when it goes out 
  (from jsmith@company.com to
  john.w.smith@company.com, for example). 
  The list software has no way of knowing
  that these are the same person. 
  See the FAQ entry on
  %a{:href => "#FAQ-ChangeOptions"} Changing your list options
  to check your current subscription. 
  You can change your email address there, or 
  if you wish to
  have the option of posting from multiple email 
  addresses, while still receiving your list 
  mail to only one of them, you can subscribe
  %i all
  the addresses to the list, and sent all but 
  one of them to "Nomail" so you do not receive
  multiple copies of list mail.
  %p
    The other (less likely) possibility is that you 
    were actually automatically
    unsubscribed from the list because your email 
    was bouncing (perhaps owing to a
    full mailbox or a server problem at your end).
    The list processor requires
    several bounces over a period of several days 
    to unsubscribe someone so you
    would have had to have a pretty serious mail 
    delivery problem for this to happen.
    %a{:href => "#FAQ-ChangeOptions"} Check your subscription
    to see if this
    happened and resubscribe (possibly under a more 
    reliable email ID).


///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ FAQ DISAPPEAR
%a{:name => "FAQ-DisappearedMail"}>
.questoin
  My mail to the list did not appear on the list and 
  I got no explanatory
  message or rejection. What happened?
.answer
  There are several possibilities. Here are various possibilities,
  from most to least likely:
  %ul
    %li
      You
      %i did
      get an explanatory message but your spam-catcher 
      was set too aggressively and filtered it. 
      Check your Junkmail or Bulkmail folder, or
      set your spam filtering options to allow all mail 
      from mailman@mit.edu,
      mailman-owner@mit.edu and mailman-bounces@mit.edu.
    %li    
      You sent an email to Tango-A but did not include the geographical prefix
      (SA:, NA-E:, NA-C:, NA-W:, EU-W:, EU-E:, AASP: or MISC:) or entered it
      incorrectly. In this case, the mail
      %i does
      get sent to everyone who has a
      digest subscription even though it didn't match any topics (since digest
      subscribers get all topics), so it is not flagged as undeliverable even though
      it in fact was not delivered as intended. Hence, you didn't get an error
      message back. Check the
      %a{:href => "tango-A-rules.htm#Topics"} 
        formatting of the
        geographical prefix at the Tango-A rules page
      , and resubmit if that was the problem.  
    %li
      Your list options are set
      %i not
      to receive a copy of your own
      postings. This is unlikely but possible, since it is not the default option
      and you would have had to change it explicitly in your subscriptions options.
      Furthermore, most subscribers
      %i want
      to see a copy of their own postings
      so are unlikely to set this option. But it's a possibility, so you can
      %a{:href => "#FAQ-ChangeOptions"} check your subscription options
      to see if
      this is the case.


///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ FAQ No Mail
%a{:name => "FAQ-NoMail"}>
.question
  I am subscribed to the list but am not
  receiving (or have stopped receiving) email from the list.
.answer
  There are several possible reasons. Here they are, along with
  possible solutions, in order of likelihood:
  %ul
    %li
      Mail from the list is being filtered by your 
      spam-catcher of mail filter.
      Check your Junkmail or Bulkmail folder, and if 
      that was the reason, set your
      spam filtering options to allow mail from the 
      Tango-L and Tango-A list(s). 
      How to do this depends on the particular spam 
      catcher, but the easiest way is to
      allow any mail that has the words Tango-L or 
      Tango-A anywhere in the header.
      If you need to be more specific, all mail from 
      the Tango-L list should have
      the email address
      %b tango-L [@] mit.edu
      in the To: or Cc: field, and all mail
      from the Tango-A list should have the email 
      address
      %b tango-A [@] mit.edu
      in the To: or Cc: field.
    %li  
      If you were having persistent problems with your 
      email delivery, it is
      possible that you got unsubscribed from the list, 
      or had your subscription
      suspended (a intermediate state before you get 
      unsubscribed). To check this,
      do the following: Log on to the list server to 
      check your subscription options
      %a{:href => "#FAQ-ChangeOptions"} 
        as described above
      .
    %li
      If neither of these is the problem, then it could 
      be a third issue that
      has sometimes cropped up: The domain
      %b mit.edu
      somehow gets tagged as a
      blacklisted domain by certain ISPs, who stop 
      delivering mail originating from
      %b mit.edu
      .


///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ FAQ Content Type
%a{:name => "FAQ-ContentType"}>
.question
  "The message's content type was not explicitly allowed"
.answer
  If you get this message, this means that the post was rejected
  automatically by the server (the list administrator will never know that this
  happened, so you should email
  tango-L-owner [@] mit.edu if you cannot resolve this problem). In general, this
  happens when you send email in HTML format and not in plaintext format (although
  it does not happen
  %i every time
  you do this ...). Send the message in
  plaintext (see
  %a{:href => "#FAQ-Plaintext"} related FAQ article
  )


///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ FAQ Remove Posting
%a{:name => "FAQ-RemovePosting"}>
.question
  I changed my mind about a posting I
  made (or said something embarrassing that I now regret, or is coming back to
  haunt me) and want to make it go away!
.answer
  Hmm, you didn't read the section in the list posting 
  rules
  %a{:href => "tango-L-rules.htm#POLICY-Privacy"}
    that addressed this topic
  . The  short answer is that the email certainly 
  cannot be withdrawn once it is sent and distributed. 
  In addition, the list is
  %a{:href => "#Archives"} archived
  in more than one Google-searchable location,
  some of which are private archives that the list 
  managers have no control or
  jurisdiction over. 
  If you believe you have a strong-enough case, you
  would need
  to contact the owners of each of these archives 
  (basically wherever you get a
  hit for your posting on Google) and request or 
  persuade them to remove the
  posting. 
  You are not likely to be 100% successful, but some 
  may accommodate you.


///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ FAQ Why Moderated
%a{:name => "FAQ-WhyModerated"}>
.question
  My mail to the list did not appear on
  the list and I got an email saying it was sent to the moderator for approval.
  Why are my posts being moderated and those of others not?
.answer
  The Tango-L and Tango-A lists are "lightly moderated," i.e., most
  members' posts go directly to the list without delay and without needing
  approval by the moderator. 
  However,
  persistent and/or intentional and/or severe violators of the list rules may have
  their postings screened (there are generally just a small handful of those at
  any given point in time). 
  A full explanation of How the Tango-L List is
  Moderated may be found at this article that was 
  posted to Tango-L, but a summary
  of all the reasons that your post may be moderated 
  appear below (most of
  them -- those in Category (1) -- 
  are innocuous technical reasons).  
  %ol
    %li
      %u>
        %b Category 1
      \. A "normal" reason that has nothing to do with
      the content of your posting
      %i per se
      :
      %ul
        %li
          %b You just joined the list.
          New members to the list (this includes
          those who resubscribed under a different email address) are automatically put
          on moderation status. This is mainly to avoid spammers who sometimes subscribe
          to lists in order to spam the entire list (although it does have the effect of
          catching most "newbie" errors also). If it is a legitimate posting, it will be
          approved, usually within 24 hours or less, or you will get a response
          explaining any modification you need to make before resubmitting it. After a
          few legitimate postings, your moderation status will be cleared and your
          messages will go through immediately.
        %li        
          %b Message too large.
          There is a limit of 5K (about 5,000
          characters) on list messages. That's about 100 lines of text and even the most
          verbose and rambling poster rarely writes that much. So either you have
          %i (a)
          sent the message in
          %a{:href => "#FAQ-Plaintext"} HTML format
          (which easily
          quadruples the size of the message) or
          %i (b)
          tried to include an
          attachment (photo, etc.) to the message (see list rules on
          %a{:href => "tango-L-rules.htm#FORMATTING-Plaintext"} No Attachments
          )
          %i (c)
          you have quoted unnecessarily from a previous 
          message (see list rules on
          %a{:href => "tango-L-rules.htm#FORMATTING-DontQuote"} 
            Limiting Quoting
          ).
          You can fix this problem, cancel your posting 
          (if the moderator didn't already reject it), 
          and resubmit. 
          In the event that you truly 
          %i did
          have a really 
          long plain-text article of several hundred lines 
          (there have been a few), the moderator will 
          automatically accept it, but you can send an
          email to Tango-L-owner [@] mit.edu pointing this 
          out if you wish.
        %li
          %b "Blind Carbon Copies not allowed" or "Too Many Recipients in the List."
          The list address (Tango-L@mit.edu
          or Tango-A@mit.edu must appear in the "To:" 
          field of your email message. 
          If you are sending a mass mailing that 
          includes Tango-L or Tango-A and your
          mailer does not explicitly but the list 
          address in the "To:" line, it will be rejected. 
          Similarly, if it
          %i is
          on the "To:" list but with many other email 
          addresses, it will also be rejected. 
          These are among the spam protection mechanisms,
          and also serves to discourage organizers from 
          adding Tango-A to their regular mailing list. 
          Send a separate email to Tango-L or Tango-A, 
          meeting all its formatting and postings rules, 
          and you should be fine.
    %li
      %u>
        %b Category 2
      \. To get the attention of someone who has some
      relatively minor violation (e.g., unnecessarily attaching the entire previous
      email), but who seems to ignore the repeated reminders they receive pointing
      this out. It generally gets their attention when they
      %i have
      to read and
      act on the reminder email in order for their posts to get through. This is
      really more like putting someone back in Category 1, since they are newbie
      type errors, rather than intentional or severe rules violations. Once it is
      clear that they have figured out how to fix their postings, their moderation
      status gets removed rather quickly.

        %b Category 3
      \. Someone is put on moderated status by the
      moderator for intentional and/or severe and/or repeated list abuse or rules
      violations, or for a statement of intent to do so, or for behaviour that
      indicates that they do not intend to follow the rules. These are the problem
      members and there are generally just a small handful of them (2-3 if at all)
      at any given point. They tend to share some or all of the following
      characteristics:
      %b
        %i (a)
      generally have an attitude, or indication
      from their words or behaviour, that they are above the rules,
      %b
        %i (b)
      tend to take up a disproportionate amount of the moderators' time and have a
      disproportionately negative influence on the list,
      %b
        %i (c)
      generally have engaged in extremely disruptive 
      behaviour such as flaming, trolling,
      rants, etc. (which are strongly enforced--see the
      %i
        %a{:href => "tango-L-rules.htm#RELEVANCE-NoFlames"}
          Section of the Tango-L list
          rules on No Flames, Rants, Swearing and Personal Attacks
      )
      %b
        %i (d)
      know that they are in this category from having received multiple
      or strong warnings. Their postings are always moderated and for an indefinite
      period. They do not receive responses to non-compliant posts or often even to
      their other correspondence until they have agreed in writing to abide by the
      rules. In some cases, none of their posts are approved anymore (even if they
      are otherwise compliant) because they have demonstrated a complete disregard
      for the rules. If you have managed to get yourself into this category, the
      only way to get your posts approved or even to receive any kind of response
      from the moderators (other than a request to be unsubscribed) is to send an
      email to tango-L-owner [@] mit.edu stating in an unqualified and sincere
      manner that you have read the rules and agree to abide by them in all future
      posts (your posts are still likely to be moderated for a while, probably
      indefinitely, owing to your past abuses and violation of implicit trust until
      you have regained that trust).

/ FAQ Why Rules Reminder
%a{:name => "FAQ-WhyRulesReminder"}
.question
  Why did I get a reminder or warning
  about a rule infraction when I see occasionally other posts that have violated
  that same rule?
.answer
  This could be for one of several reasons:
  %ul
    %li
      Your posts are still being moderated (see the
      %a{:href => "#FAQ-WhyModerated"} FAQ entry above
      ) 
    %li
      Since the moderators don't necessary read every post or read them every
      day, some rules violations, even blatant ones, may escape his attention. Yours
      was probably noticed and/or brought to the moderators' attention while the
      other wasn't.

  In either case, you are encouraged to bring the other offending post to the
  moderators' attention if you wish, by forwarding a copy of it to tango-L-owner
  [@] mit.edu.


///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ FAQ Dont Like Rules
%a{:name => "FAQ-DontLikeRules"}
.question
  What if I don't agree with the list
  rules or the way they are being enforced?
.answer
  Depending on your exact issue, there are different answers:
  %ul
    %li
      Participation in the Tango-L and Tango-A lists 
      requires that you agree to abide by the list rules. 
      If you do not so agree, you are required by the 
      rules to
      %a{:href => "#Subscribe"} unsubscribe
      from the list. You may still read
      posts by others at the
      %a{:href => "#Archives"} list archives
      .
    %li
      If you feel the rules are not being adequately 
      enforced, to the detriment
      of the list, you may send a copy of the violating 
      post(s) and the moderators
      will take action on it if necessary, and depending 
      on their time and workload.
      (If you wish to volunteer as a list moderator, you 
      may also indicate your
      desire to do so and help the time and workload issue.)
    %li
      If you feel your posts are being denied
      %i even though they comply with all the rules
      , you may send a politely worded explanation of 
      your point of view to the moderators at 
      tango-L-owner [@] mit.edu, and they will reply 
      if they accept your explanation. 
      (Make sure you have read the
      %a{:href => "tango-L-rules.htm"} Tango-L
      and
      %a{:href => "tango-A-rules.htm"} Tango-A
      rules, as well as the article on
      %i
        %a{:href => "tango-L-moderation.htm"}
          How the Tango-L List is Moderated
      before you do so.) 
      There is currently no other appeal mechanism. 
      Rude, defiant or abusive emails will not be 
      responded to (and is not likely to further your case anyway).


///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ FAQ Other
%a{:name => "FAQ-Other"}>
.question
  I have another question that is not answered on the FAQ nor anywhere else on
  this website as far as I can tell.
.answer
  Send an email to the list owner at Tango-L-owner 
  [@] mit.edu with your
  question and he will attempt to answer it 
  (and possibly include it on the next
  edition of the FAQ if others are likely to have a 
  similar question). 
  Make sure
  to include any supporting email you got 
  (preferably with all the headers) and
  exactly what you did and what unexpected response 
  (or lack of response) you got.
  (Just saying, "It didn't work," doesn't give much 
  to go on ...) If your question
  %i is
  on the FAQ but following the steps specified 
  didn't work, be sure to
  mention this (including all the steps you did 
  in detail and their results),
  otherwise the list administrator is just likely 
  to point you back to that FAQ entry!
