  Relationship to Tango-L)<br>
&nbsp;</b></font><ol type="a">
  <li><b><a name="Nature-Announcement"></a>Announcement of Tango Events.</b>&nbsp; Tango-A is intended for Announcements of Tango events worldwide.
General-interest discussion of Tango that are not event-specific are
probably generally more appropriate on Tango-L. (If you have not subscribed to 
  Tango-L, you may wish to do so by reviewing the <a href="index.htm#Subscribe">
  subscription instructions</a>.<br>
<br>
These events could include Tango workshops or lessons, Tango weeks or
weekends, Milongas, classes, etc. Information on Tango events that
have interest only to a local geographical area are explicitly
permitted. In this regard, Tango-A complements Tango-L, since the
latter discourages announcements of local events and advertising owing to its more
global scope and its focus on discussion. Thus, <b>articles should not be 
  cross-posted to both Tango-A and Tango-L</b> since they are almost always more appropriate
on one or the other.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b><a name="Nature-WhereToDance"></a>Where to Dance Tango in &lt;Some City&gt;?</b>&nbsp;
Since Tango-A is geographically organized (see below), postings
on &quot;Where can I dance Tango in &lt;some city&gt;?&quot; are also more appropriate
on Tango-A than on Tango-L (put a question mark at the end of the
&quot;Subject&quot; in this case to help readers identify it as a query).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b><a name="Nature-BsAsAccommodation"></a>Tango Community Accommodations 
  in Buenos Aires.</b>&nbsp; In general, advertising for travel-related
services (transportation and accommodation) that is not directly tango-related 
  is not permitted, although such
information may be included as part of an announcement of a tango tour or event. The only 
  exception, allowed by popular request, is that advertising for accommodation for Tango dancers 
  in Buenos Aires (only) <i>is</i> permitted as long as it is <i>(a)</i> offered 
  by someone in the Tango community (we don't want every real-estate agent in 
  Buenos Aires posting here) and <i>(b)</i> follows the once-in-three-months
  <a href="#Frequency">frequency guidelines</a> (it should use the geographical 
  topic <b>SA:</b>).</li>
</ol>
  <p>Anything that is NOT directly related to Tango is not appropriate for 
  Tango-A (or Tango-L)--this includes commentary (positive or negative) about 
  how others post.<font size="4"><br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><b><font size="4"><a name="Topics"></a>Use of Geographical Topics<br>
&nbsp;</font></b><ol type="a">
    <li><b><a name="Topics-Intro"></a>Introduction to Topics.</b>&nbsp;
Tango-A uses a &quot;topics&quot; feature&nbsp; to provide the ability
effectively to have several sublists by geographical area. It is important that 
    you understand how these work since <i>(a)</i> as a poster, you need to know 
    that all postings
need to specify the geographical area <b>in which it is held</b>, and <i>(b)</i> as a 
    subscriber, you may wish to customize the topics you subscribe to so that you
will only receive announcements for the areas of interest to you
(although you are welcome to subscribe to all topics if you are
interested, and indeed most subscribers tend to do that, perhaps because it is 
    the default, or perhaps because they are interested in what else is going on 
    in the Tango world outside their area).<br>
    <br>
The following topics have been defined, corresponding to the
geographical areas indicated. (The divisions have been selected
based on a combination of criteria including level of Tango
activity and &quot;community of interest&quot; consideration, and may
be revised based on usage, if a different division proves
to be superior.)<br>
<br>
    <b>SA:</b> South America.<br>
    <b>NA-E:</b> Eastern North America: essentially areas in the Eastern and
Atlantic time zones (USA or Canada), or adjacent to the Atlantic, e.g., Cancun, 
    Mexico or Carribean islands.<br>
    <b>NA-C:</b> Central North America: essentially areas in the Central and 
    Mountain time zones (USA or Canada) or interior to the continent, e.g., 
    Mexico City<br>
    <b>NA-W:</b> Western North America: essentially areas in the Pacific Time 
    zone (USA or Canada) or adjacent to the Pacific, e.g., Acapulco, Mexico, or 
    Hawaii.<br>
    <b>EU-W:</b> Western Europe.<br>
    <b>EU-E:</b> Eastern Europe.<br>
    <b>AASP:</b> Asia, Africa and South Pacific.<br>
<br>
    <b>MISC:</b> In addition, a MISC topic exists, that should only be used when
there is no fit for any of the other topics, i.e., when it is an
announcement that, by its nature is not geographically oriented.
E.g., announcement of a new source for purchase of Tango music
on the Internet.<br>
<br>
    <b>ADMIN:</b> This is a special topic for use for postings by the
administrator only, for important administrative information
about Tango-A. <b><u>IMPORTANT</u>:</b> If you ever change the topics
your are subscribed to, make sure that you never remove the
ADMIN topic as you could miss the infrequent but important
administrative messages!<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b><a name="Topics-Use"></a>Use of Topics in Postings.</b>&nbsp;
All postings <b>must</b> specify as its topic the <b>one</b> geographical area it 
    applies to. If the event is close to a border between areas, you must choose 
    the more applicable one of the two. Note that this does not limit your potential
audience since those who are interested in areas outside their &quot;home&quot;
area are free to subscribe to the topics corresponding to all the
areas that interest them, while still only subscribing to one list.
(By default, new subscribers are subscribed to all topics.)<br>
<br>
Topics are specified by preceding the subject line with the topic name
followed by a colon. E.g.,<br>
<br>
    <b>Subject: NA-E: New Milonga every 2nd Sunday in New York City<br>
    </b>
<br>
    <i><b>NOTE: If no topic is used (or if the colon is omitted or the topic 
    abbreviation is mis-spelt), the postings
will not go to any list members, so please make sure to specify the appropriate 
    topic in the correct format!<br>
&nbsp;</b></i></li>
    <li><b><a name="Topics-Multiple"></a>Multiple Topics are Not Supported.</b>&nbsp; 
    When the Tango-A list was originally hosted on the listserv server, multiple 
    topics were supported. However, <i>they are no longer supported</i> (and 
    indeed was found to be of little use for Tango-A) and the use of multiple 
    topics will result in your posting not being seen by the intended audience!<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b><a name="Topics-Selection"></a>Topics Selection for Subscribers<br>
    <br>
    </b>The preceding paragraphs describe setting the topic when you <b><i>
    submit</i></b> an article to the list; the following paragraphs specify how 
    you set the topics you want to <b><i>receive</i></b>.<br>

<br>
  <b>One-time major special events (e.g., Tango congresses of 1 week or

  <b>Announcements other than forthcoming events:</b> <i>(a)</i> An announcement that
is by its nature 1-time but doesn't fall into the category of a
forthcoming event (e.g., announcement of a new Tango research project)
may, of course, be announced when it occurs or at the appropriate

(e.g., source of Tango music) may be made once every 3 months, or if
there is a significant change (change of address, phone number to order, etc.)
  <i>(c)</i> Announcements of Tango-related accommodation in Buenos Aires may be

Tango-A is primarily for postings on Tango events and secondarily
for updates on those events and for inquiries on where one can
find Tango in particular regions of the world. Objective review of
an event, or pertinent and informative review of teachers are
permitted; however, &quot;bashing&quot; of an event or a teacher (e.g., by a
competing organizer, or someone acting on behalf of a competing
organizer), is not permitted. See the
<a href="tango-L-rules.htm#RELEVANCE-NoFlames">Tango-L rules on No Flames and 
Reviews</a>.<br>
<br>
In all cases, announcements and followups should stick to being
informative. Brief biographical information on teachers (in the case
of a class or workshop) are fine, but no &quot;marketing hype,&quot; please.
(You may include a link to a web page that has additional information,
more verbose details on detailed timing and description of workshops,
etc., if you wish, as well as all the marketing hype you want!)<b><font size="4"><br>
