Hi all,

First, if you don't like alternative music for tango, please use your delete key.  This thread is not for you.

I've decided I need to work on convincing people here to continue studying traditional music.  Although some alternative music (non-Piazzolla) is fun, most of it is not terribly deep or complex.  So some folks think they are being musical and they really aren't.  I thought one approach would be to point out the enduring quality of the great orchestras that keeps dancers challenged whereas most alternative tangos today only have a lifespan of about 2-3 years, by my estimation.  Piazzolla, of course, is the exception.  Can anyone think of any alternative tango that we might actually be dancing to in 30 years?  I can't.

Trini de Pittsburgh

P.S.  I deejayed a milonga last night and decided to play some swing music since it was the Fourth.  Even though we had swing dancers, to my surprise, people were still trying to tango to it.  A few years ago, everyone would have known that it was swing.

Message-ID: <009601c7bff3$922adff0$b6809fd0$@com>

I do like to dance tango to good music other than tango.

Unfortunately, this music is not the music played mostly at alternative
milongas.

You said "alternative music" is simplistic. The problem is that so called
"alternative music" for tango does not have style. It is an eclectic mix. It
is a byproduct of pop-music, it is "soap" music. Much of it functions well
creating a good mood, but as the whole it lucks many thing. It is visible
that many authors are trying to lift their music higher in musical
qualities, but since it still stays the part of pop-music these efforts are
bound to fail.

Music at alternative milongas is assembled to satisfy dancing styles of Neo
Tango dancers. Like Homer. It supposed to be slooooww. Since this style of
dancing is very young and just developing, there is no matching musical
tradition, musical trend. So they just pick up pieces here and there which
are more suitable for their dancing. 

The best "Non-Tango Tango" ( that is how I prefer to call it) are swing,
foxtrot, salsa, rumba, samba, indian music, anything which is the part of
established musical and dancing tradition. I have found that Disco style
music is great for non-tango too. Especially for those who like ( and are
able to dance) rhythmic driving style of tango - orillero. I have danced to
Cajun music - they watched in amusement asking what we are doing - they
liked it.

It is difficult to preserve dancing skills from generation to generation.
Music is much easier to preserve. That is why all this music: swing, samba,
and so on is easy to dance the right dance to: it is preserving style once
you start dancing to the music. If you are good, sooner or later you will
dance the right dance to it. Because dance is in our body, not in the minds
of teachers. There is no such thing for alternative tango. Alternative Tango
( Neo Tango - the name I prefer to call it, and now you understand why )
does not have matching music style yet. And that is the real problem for
them.

There is a problem with it located beyond musical qualities. Once ( in
Denver ) a DJ started to play a set of great old foxtrots. What could be
better for a milonga ! I invited one young lady. She said "Not to this music
!". I said "Why - it is so perfectly danceable, driving?". "I hate it!!!"
she said.

Igor Polk
PS. Can you tell me why did she say so? I am interested to know, I am an
immigrant: this is beyond my understanding yet.

Was it you, Robin?

Just yesterday, I have danced with several people I did not dance with or
danced very long time ago. I have made amazing discoveries. How can you
start knowing someone other than trying to dance with her or him?

Well, there are styles favorable by your partner and yourself, but one
should be able do dance to all styles. This is called musicality. I do not
understand why many people think that one can dance only to one style of
music? That is the whole fun - to dance well to many kinds of music.

A good dancer listens to music and tries to dance the way music tells him to
dance. The one who dances the same way all the time just memorized his way
of dancing. He is lucky if a DJ put the right music for him, otherwise it is
wrong and boring, I understand you. But this is not the way it should be.

Igor.
PS you can consider ability to dance differently to different orchestras the
second level of musicality. Contrary to ability to dance well to the music
of a favorite style.

Perhaps I had chosen the wrong type of swing music.  Do you have a favorite piece?

Hi there,

I totally agree with Trini's assessment of the longevity of most alternative 
tangos, and also believe that there is a place for some alternative tangos 
and music at milongas - for lots of reasons which have been discussed 
before.

Having said that, I too, feel that those of us who deejay or teach the 
dance, play an important role in educating our fellow dancers to develop a 
better understanding & appreciation of the traditional music which has made 
this dance endure and become so popular internationally. In my opinion, this 
educative role must include fostering the skills which enable dancers to 
respond sensitively to the many possibilities offered by those great tango 
orchestras. We all know it's a long process, but the journey can be 
enjoyable and deeply satisfying.

Have a good weekend.

About 2-3 years ago I experimented with playing non-traditional music for
milongas. I define 'non-traditional' as anything other than 'traditional'
tango for dancing from the 30s, 40s, and early 50s. The term 'alternative',
I believe, is generally applied to non-tango music used for dancing tango,
and I did not use any of that because, as someone with a history of ballroom
dancing, I feel the rhythm of these 'alternative' songs fit other dances
such as foxtrot, rumba, samba, etc. However, an 'alternative' milonga goes
beyond 'alternative' music.

Outside the traditional tango music, there is some Pugliese from the 70s
(Desde el Alma, A Evaristo Carriego) that could be considered 'classic' in
that they have become part of the repertoire of a traditional DJ such that
they can even be heard on rare occasions in Buenos Aires milongas.
Contemporary orchestras such as Color Tango (Pugliese), Gente de Tango (Di
Sarli), Los Reyes del Tango (D'arienzo), and San Souci (Calo) can provide
renditions of classic tangos that are close to classic tango and thus they
don't really classify as 'non-traditional', although they may provide a nice
change of pace. There are some other contemporary orchestras such as Trio
Garufa (US) and Los Cosos de al Lao (Argentina) that provide some danceable
music, usually when doing covers of classic tangos, albeit with their own
style and this may by some guidelines cross over the line into
non-traditional. But I don't think that's what you're referring to.

Certainly Horacio Salgan added some novel interpretations to classic tangos
with jazz influences. I find some tangos and valses by Quinteto Real (e.g.,
A la gran mun~eca, El pollo Ricardo, Gran Hotel Victoria, Romance de barrio,
Palomita blanca) to be quite danceable, although I've also heard complaints
that some people find this music difficult to dance to. I would consider
Salgan 'non-traditional' and having the complexity to make it interesting
enough to keep within a DJ's repertoire of milonga music

Piazzolla has very few tangos that maintain a constant rhythm at a danceable
tempo, yet those few that exist (e.g., Libertango, Zum, Preparense,
Tanguedia I & III) can make a nice contrast in a milonga setting and, of
course, do not cease to be interesting.

Pablo Aslan has created an interesting artistic fusion of tango and jazz,
but very little of it maintains a constant rhythm for dancing.

El Arranque is creating wonderfully new tango music and one may find a few
that are suitable for dancing, but this is not their primary objective.

I do like the Symphonic Tango CD where Pablo Ziegler's quintet plays with a
symphonic orchestra, but only Caminito, El Choclo, and La Cumparsita are
suitable for dancing, although some may find even these challenging.

Tango electronico is the modern genre used most frequently at milongas in
the US. I find almost none of this music inspiring for dancing tango.
However, Otros Aires has some good milongas (Milonga sentimental, Amore que
se baila) that maintain an authentic milonga rhythm. Electrocutango has a
good milonga (Retrolonga) and a good tango (Felino); beyond that is
stretching a bit to call something tango. Carla Pugliese mixes a bit of
electronica without completely deserting traditional tango, and has several
recorded tangos with electronic overlay suitable for dancing (e.g., La vida
y la tempestad, Ostinato, La cumparsita), a mix of grandfather Osvaldo's
style with electronica, but she also has recorded some more traditional
tangos (Gallo ciego, Pata ancha, Pavadita) lacking electronic elements, as
well as some Piazzolla compositions (e.g., Obiivion). In my opinion, Carla
Pugliese represents the only contemporary bridge between the past and the
future of danceable tango, i.e., adding electronic elements that does not
destroy the rhythm and felling of tango. The problem with most 'tango
electronico' (Gotan Project, Carlos Libedisky, Jaime Wilensky, Tanghetto,
Bajo Fondo tango Club, etc.) is that either there is no tango rhythm, or
whatever tango rhythm exists is overwhelmed by a pounding elctronic bass
drum. Tango electronico basically consists of adding tango elements
(sometimes only a bandoneon) to a disco rhythm. It is suitable to dance
hustle and night club 2-step to some tango electronico because it has the
appropriate rhythm. Rarely does dancing tango fit the rhythm well. It just
feels awkward.

The main reasons that as a DJ I stopped using non-traditional tango are that
some dancers complained the music was difficult to connect to, whereas
others used the energy of some of these modern compositions to bring out
their exhibition tango to the fullest extent. Navigational suffered and, of
course, connection with the music evaporated. So I stopped. i didn't want to
facilitate that.

So, to answer your question, Trini, it one wants to go beyond the realm of
traditional tango to find music suitable for dancing tango I would suggest
Salgan, Piazzolla, some Otros Aires, and Carla Pugliese. if they are still
played at milongas 30 years from now, I'll dance to them.

Yes. She did not hate the music. She just hated the idea of dancing
tango (*) steps to something that is not tango (*). I don't think
understanding this has anything to do with being an immigrant or not.

In Minneapolis, there are some tangueros with serious ballroom 
dancing backgrounds.  One couple in particular automatically 
dances swing, rumba, cha-cha, foxtrot or whatever else seems 
appropriate to them to a lot of alternative music.  I love it 
when they do that, because if the DJ wanted them to dance tango
steps to non-traditional music, he shouldn't have asked dancers 
to ram a square peg into a round hole.

As a DJ, I could tell stories about some requests I get for 
alternative music, but I think I'll pass on that ... I'm trying 
to be a good boy. ;)

Christopher

PS.  I love what Andres Amarillo posted many months back: "Tango 
*is* alternative".  It's become my stock answer when I'm not in 
the mood to accommodate such requests.

My impression is that people who can hear and dance to the steady rhythms of the classic tangos (up to and including Pugliese and those who adopted the same musical principles) can also dance to more modern pieces. That applies whether the more modern pieces are promoted as Tango or whether they are just popular music to which some people attempt to dance Tango.

However, the reverse is not true. People who regularly dance to the more modern pieces cannot always dance to the classics (although obviously some can).

I think that the difference lies in two realms. The first is that with the classics one has to dance to the rhythm that the orchestra is using. For the alternative pieces, one has, as it were, a rhythm in one's head and one imposes that rhythm on the dance. If one relies on that internal rhythm, it is difficult to transfer the skill to a rhythm which is imposed externally.

The other difference is in the walk - whether one walks on the ball of the foot first or on the heel first. The ball-first dancers (male or female) have rather more time then do the heel-first ones. That? means that the men have a little more time to change direction, swivel, pause or whatever, and ladies have a little more time to react to such changes.

With both classic and alternative music the ball-first dancers have no problems. However, the heel-first dancers have a slight time delay. Rather than their weight transfer taking place on the beat, it arrives slightly late. That, as far as I can see, is because their heel lands on the beat, but the weight has not been fully transferred. There is then a slight delay for the weight to be transferred to the ball. That is what appears to account for the fact that they always seem to be slightly out of time with the music. As usual, irrespective of the direction in which you are moving, the heel acts as a brake.

Of course, you can only be out of time with the music when the music actually has a time! When there is no obvious time, one can continue to move as one wishes - it's just that one is not dancing to the music. Once one has mastered the ball-first, weight-forward way of moving, one can then dance to any? music - old or new.

This phenomenon, of the heel-first dancers being slightly behind the music, first hit me when watching people dancing milonga.

Sorry, it might be out of order, but, the list is not that formal, so I feel
I can give some clarification, thank you, Konstantin for pointing it out.

It was an alternative milonga. She was dancing to electronic mixes before.


The story was: "Once ( in Denver ) a DJ started to play a set of great old
foxtrots. What could be better for a milonga ! I invited one young lady. She
said "Not to this music !". I said "Why - it is so perfectly danceable,
driving?". "I hate it!!!" she said."

And my question was "Why did she said so?"
Igor.
PS. Why one would want to dance tango steps to foxtrot? Using the level of
artistry obtained in tango a tango dancer can easily invent moves suitable
for such simple ( and pleasant ) dance like foxtrot. Besides, have you tried
to dance milonga to foxtrots of 30s? Try it !

I have met one gentlemen of about 90 years old. I asked him what did he do
when he was young. He was at that time in Ireland. He answered: "I went
dancing 5 nights a week. We danced mostly tango and foxtrot". He was about
20 at that time.

Laurie, but tango is the dance where heel-first steps are very important.

You have made an interesting observation that heel-first dancing is
considered by someone behind the music.
Very interesting, thank you! 

You have made me think about the technique from quite a different angle,
thank you again for the great post !

Ron, at Tango Society wrote
"The main reasons that as a DJ I stopped using non-traditional tango are that
some dancers complained the music was difficult to connect to, whereas
others used the energy of some of these modern compositions to bring out
their exhibition tango to the fullest extent. Navigational suffered and, of
course, connection with the music evaporated. So I stopped. i didn't want to
facilitate that."

Thank you Ron for keeping tango pure
When I think of traditional music and in particular, navigation, I'll always 
telling people who have never been there yet,  to go to BsAs.
There are so many milongas in the US where people have never experienced 
dancing on a crowded dance floor where it seems the entire floor moves as one. 
Hundreds of people dancing on the floor and as if they were all linked together, 
dancing as one. The couple dancing next to you having just as much impact on 
what your next step will be as your partner. I love it and miss it.
There are a number of milongas in Cleveland where all types of music is 
played, and where people dance tango traditionally to neuvo and stage on the same 
floor. I feel it can be a little intimidating to dance on a dance floor if you 
are dancing traditional and the couple next to you are dancing stage and you 
don't know where there next step will take them. I will continue to keep 
Alegria the only traditional floor in town.

It has been so frustrating to take so many lessons all these years where the 
instructor stress heel-toe or toe-heel and not being able to say why or what 
the reason is. No one has been able to convince me which is the better, so I 
came up with my own opinion. But 
here, who I believe to be a non-instructor hit the nail on the head. I loved 
your post Laurie.
So I would like to add my $0.02.
First, it very hard to land toe-heel if you are taking long steps. Short ones 
yes. So when I'm dancing tango, and I'm taking long slow steps, I'm using my 
heel-toe, as where in the milonga I'm taking shorter quicker steps, I'm using 
my toe-heel.
Then I think of balance and walking as they say, Like a Cat.
Two people, three legs on the floor. First shown to me by Robert Hauk of 
Portland, OR. The leader steps forward, the follower also stepping backward and 
then also collecting, where the leader still continues to keep their behind foot 
on the floor trailing their forward step. Much better balance.

I don't completely agree with all this.

A lot of great, traditional argentine dancers dance behind the music,  
or perhaps they are dancing through the beat rather than "on" the  
beat. In other words, trying to exactly step on the beat doesn't  
capture the part of tango that occurs between the beat. This is a  
hard concept for me as I started as a rhythmic dancer and I dance  
pretty much to the beat. However, as I get better I notice that my  
insistence on beat exactitude may be hindering my musicality.

Hsueh-tze Lee of Boston works a lot with this concept. She is a 15  
year dancer and excellent teacher with many miles on the Buenos Aires  
dance floors with the great social dancers. I trust that she knows  
more than I do about what they do, so I have to pay attention when  
she tells me this, even if it contradicts some of my own training.


Second, performance dancers have certain needs and training which  
require weight over the ball. Social dancer have different needs as  
they are expressing very subtle things to their partner, not to an  
audience. For them. varying the foot placement (heel and ball)  
enables a lot more richness than ball-first alone would give them.  
Managing heel and ball gives them control over the time and space  
between steps.


Here is a specific description:

Landing heel first, then shifting to the ball allows the leader to  
control the speed with which the follower "collects", that is brings  
her feet together. If you desire her to collect quickly, then you  
would want to shift quickly to the ball; if you want her to collect  
slowly, then you would hold back on your heel, and shift forward  
(four inches?) a bit later in time. This allows you to "jazz" the  
arrival, that is hold back the tempo of the collection.

So, as an exercise in delaying your arrival, you could take a step,  
placing your weight (let's say you hold your hip back a bit) over the  
heel. Your floating leg holding back about the length of one shoe.  
Shift weight (the hip) to the ball, while collecting together (shift  
back and forth a couple times to sense the heel-ball combined with  
leg-pendulum). This gives you a new technique for managing your  
follower's movements.

To delay the initiation of the new step, you could sneak the foot  
forward about a shoe-length, while softening the knee in preparation  
for a stride. The sensitive follower feels your preparation and  
starts to stretch her leg backward. She typically stays on her ball,  
although many followers frequently rest for a moment on their heels.

So I've just described two examples of using weight and heel/ball  
control to change the tempo of movement behind or ahead of the so- 
called beat. Slow down the arrival, or slow down the take-off.  
Playing with these ideas is giving me a lot of new and interesting  
movement possibilities.

Tomas Howlin (an argentine who now lives in Montreal is an  
experienced and skilled dancer) awakened me to these ideas.

But these two statements are not contradictory because my comment does
not say or imply anything about your intent, or lack thereof, in not
providing all relevant details. I hope you are not jumping to

You seem irritated. I hope I am mistaken and you are allright. In
general, whenever you ask a question in a public forum ("PS. Can you
tell me why did she say so? I am interested to know, I am an
immigrant: this is beyond my understanding yet."), you run the risk of
getting replies from people, and you have no control over who these

What do you recommend to put on a floor to keep it from being sticky?

I'm hosting a once-a-month practica on a pretty sticky floor. I  
believe it's just linoleum that's been painted black. For the last  
few practicas, I've used All Purpose flour to smooth things out.  
There are a couple problems with this: it's not a completely

and it tracks all over the place. What are some other solutions for  
this?

If you have a painted floor it's going to be very difficult to keep it 
from being sticky (the type of paint makes a difference; latex or epoxy 
are the stickiest and enamel would be better).  Make sure the floor is 
absolutely clean; when we had dances in a bar once a week we had to mop 
the floor at least 2 hours beforehand to get the beer, etc off the 
floor.  If it's still sticky, a better solution than flour is 
hard-milled cornmeal (there are different types of cornmeal and the 
non-hard-milled type may just get moist and stop working).  Baby powder 
also works but not as well as cornmeal.  Obviously, both of those you 
have to clean up afterwards.  If you are thinking this is too high 
maintenance then I would suggest finding another venue.  The floor is 
definitely a critical component in being able to execute pivots and 
other moves well, particularly for beginning dancers, and experienced 
dancers will actually avoid dance events with bad floors, because they 
are a headache to dance on rather than a pleasure.

Ben, 

Have you tried talc (baby powder)?

I always keep a bottle in my bag where ever I go. Not only does it keep the shoes gliding but also comes in handy if one were to ever meet a mother with child who is having a nappy rash emergency.

Has he been dj-ing in Montreal recently?  Or does anyone know whether he is out of town on an extended trip?Any help in contacting him will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

What Igor writes is correct, but I have seen many, many leaders--including 
some who teach tango for a living--who dance exactly the same way to every 
piece of music by every orchestra.  There is also a follower's counterpart 
to this.  That is, using the same embellishments with the same timing 
regardless of the music.

Message-ID: <8C99065175A36FF-B80-132D@WEBMAIL-RE12.sysops.aol.com>

I was told by an old ballroom competitor/judge/instructor about the secret of soap.? Yes, that's right, a bar of soap to smooth out a sticky floor.?? I carry a bar of soap in my dance bag just for that purpose.? If I encounter a floor that is either too slow, too fast , or too uneven, rubbing soap on the soles of one's shoes? really does seem to help.

I don't recommend soaping down your floor, but if you can find something waxy like tallow that won't adhere too strongly to leather or suede, you might have a solution (so to say).

What do you recommend to put on a floor to keep it from being sticky?

I'm hosting a once-a-month practica on a pretty sticky floor. I  
believe it's just linoleum that's been painted black. For the last  
few practicas, I've used All Purpose flour to smooth things out.  
There are a couple problems with this: it's not a completely  
effective solution, it's a pain in the butt to sweep up afterwards,  
and it tracks all over the place. What are some other solutions for  
this?

Thanks!

Hi Huck
I am other Alberto  , than the one mentioned in your posting.

The mention to a voice replacing Gardel, is from a poem wrote by Raul Gonzalez Tu?on, a writer , journalist and poet, on 1936, when the remnants of Carlos Gardel came for their burial at Chacarita cemetery.

The name of the poem is "Death and burial  of Gardel - The death of the singer " , and was read in off by Julio Jorge Nelson , in a film "Carlos Gardel - Story of an idol" (1964), in a part of the filme that showed historic footage of the arrival to chacarita cemetery of Carlos Gardel remnants (february 1936)

The poem ends saying
" Maybe, when the snow fall again over our city,
another voice will be equal "

 Quiz?s, cuando otra vez vuelva a caer la nieve 
sobre nuestra ciudad, otra voz ser? igual.

1st, the snow.  I live here.  It was amazing.  You can read about it on 
my blog. (http://tangospam.typepad.com) It was totally bizarre to look 
out my balcony doors and see a blizzard of white.  As for the Gardel 
rumor, never heard it, and it is not even be mentioned here at all.

2nd, the toe first and then to smooth to the side is taught by many 
people. (If we are talking about the same thing)  Mimi Santapa teaches 
it, so did Miguel Balmaceda, and many others.  When people walk flat on 
their feet in tango it makes them heavy and difficult to move.  Women 
also dance with the weight on their big toes.  It makes you very light.  
You must have your balance so you don't fall. (Please read this as 
weight on the big toes and not as dancing on your tip toes)

MASTERS

A master tango dancer has a lot of control over their foot placement.

They can choose whether to land heel or ball first, depending on the  
technical needs of the situation. Also, if you watch, the master  
dancer may land flat-footed, and it takes a discerning eye to  
determine whether they are landing first on the heel or first on the  
toe.

Any high-end ballroom dancer would say the same thing.

As I said before, control of weight over heel OR ball allows for a  
greater control over how fast or whether the follower collects. Using  
only one or the takes away options.


BEGINNERS.

The problem with teaching beginners toe-first is that it imposes a  
distracting detail on them. Worrying about that specific detail takes  
away learning more important things like balance and just moving  
around the floor. It is far better to start with a natural walk and  
emphasize posture, balance, walking in a straight line, leading &  
following.

I teach many men how to dance tango. These are "normal" guys, not  
necessarily previous dancers or young athletes. The first problem is  
just getting them to feel comfortable and competent enough to stick  
around for more than a few lessons.

As we all know, tango takes a number of years to perfect, so they'll  
get plenty of chances later.

Hi Igor  and all

Lots of people teach toe-first (actually I would say 'ball first' --  
the only real 'toe first' is en pointe).

In my experience, they are mostly people who trained first in ballet.

Some who teach this, but by no means all, also dance like this. For  
women especially, its very clear that if their heel never touches the  
ground, then the ball of the foot always gets both first contact and  
weight.

Many teachers, despite what they teach, actually dance like most  
people: with the placement of both first contact, and weight, varying  
hugely depending on where they are going and where they have been, in  
a usefully dynamic way.

Excellent dancers have great control over this; the rest of us do as  
we can.  I think its generally a distraction for beginners to even  
think about this stuff.

I used to get annoyed at the discrepancy between what people teach  
and what they do: I am gradually learning to find it entertaining  
instead...

Gary

I personally know of one young dancer of the Mora Godoy school in Buenos 
Aires who taught this technique. Another young dancer, visiting from Colon, 
is teaching this method in Sydney, Australia.
The former encouraged us to push off on the standing leg to cover more 
distance. My take on this technique is that it is useful only under some 
circumstances. One walks differently even while dancing to the same piece of 
music, depending on the dynamics of the music which calls for the physical 
implementation by different footwork.

 Tom is correct when he says that most good Tango dancers use either heel or ball first
 depending on the situation and which is more appropriate. But the point is they dont need to
 think about it. Because of training and practice, both feel equally natural and easy to use. The
 question is which should be taught? Unlike Tom, Im of the view that ball-first should be taught
 and some of the reasons are:

 1. Ball first produces a far more elegant walk and style of dancing than heel first. 

 2. Ball first helps beginner students to learn to walk with a forward posture. Heel first tends to
  produce a backward posture, which is what we have in Ballroom Tango.

 3. Students will quickly understand the difference between dancing and walking. I know many
  people who, even with 5 years experience, still walk the Tango and have never danced a
  step. 

 4. Students who are taught heel first will be stuck with it and will never be able to dance ball 
 first. It would be nice to think, as Tom does, that students will continue to learn for a number of
 years. Unfortunately, we all know that isnt the case. 

 5. Students who are taught ball first will easily be able to use heel first, when the situation
 arises, without the need for additional instruction. Its more natural and we can all do it  already  why teach it? And, as Tom correctly states  using only one or the takes away 
 options. 

 6. Unlike Tom, I dont think learning ball first imposes a distracting detail. I think its a 
 fundamental aspect in teaching students to dance Tango. And the sooner, the better.

Yes, but only because walking ball first forces you to land with a straight leg. It's the straight leg that gives the elegance. It's equally as elegant IMO to land heel first, as long as you do it with a straight leg.

We are in agreement on the main technical point, i.e. dancers should  
be skilled at multiple techniques.

Actually, we both agree that carrying your weight or balance forward  
over the balls is important. I just want them to walk "normally" and  
hit the ground heels first rather than reaching with the toes.

Stylistic disagreements are subjective. Neither heels nor balls is  
inherently more or less elegant.

Our most important disagreement is with respect to methodologies for  
teaching beginners. I claim (based on over 10 years of experience)  
that you get better progress and retention if you work with the  
skills they have when they walk in the door. In this case, "normal,  
sidewalk walking", which I truly believe is a better foundation for  
learning tango than trying to teach a new, specific detail of foot  
placement.

I certainly disagree that people who learn heels first are stuck with  
it forever; that depends on training over their tango career, not  
their first year experience. In contrast, bad posture deforms their  
technique through time, like a flaw in a growing crystal, and it is  
REALLY difficult to unlearn later on.

Jay,

I suggest you stand facing the mirror of your local dance school and then walk forward using the 2 alternatives of heel first or ball first with the feet turned slightly out and landing on the outside edge of the ball. I agree you need the straight leg, with either style. If you still think heel first looks equally elegant, then fine - stick with it.

Keith, HK

Morning, 

I agree with the teaching and doing. I have been taught to point and then step on the ball of my foot. But watching the male teachers dance, they tend to only do this on initial steps. Interestingly I am actually trying to stop going up on my toes, my previous dance experiance was all about being up on my toes, in tango its the ball of the foot. It really is a mental challange to flatten my foot especially when doing giros.

Thank you very much everyone who send me info on who is teaching the

How about the heel? Who is teaching the heel-first method of walking?

I mean famous names in tango: Argentineans, local well known-around
teachers, people who establish trends.

Is your weight on the metatarsal or the heel when you take a step?

I teach with three milongueros.  Beto walks heel first; Roberto Angel walks
on the metatarsal with the heel barely touching the floor; and Osvaldo
places the entire foot at once.  Each has developed his own personal style
and does what works for him.  Each has his own way of turning.  They have
one thing in common--a firm embrace.

Social dancers should find what works for them.  It doesn't matter
how you step.  What matters is that you dance with your heart and soul.

Thinking about your feet isn't going to improve your social dancing as much
as connecting with the music.  Tango isn't about how you look to others -- 
it's about how you feel with your partner.

Subject: [Tango-L] So, what is better, heel of toe?
Message-ID: <003401c7c4ab$66438060$32ca8120$@com>

So what is better: heel first or ball first?

I have found out of the people's responses and watching some videos of
masters ( did not really paid much attention to it before), there are some
preferences, but they are rather personal. All great dancers are fluent in
both methods, and it is possible to dance in any style with any method. And
mixing the methods makes the performance much richer.

I myself dance on heels, on toes, on flat, in open and in close, with lean,
without lean, fast, slow, sharp, smooth. And I like everything equally.

Janis put it right: it does not matter much what goes first. Although at
advanced level it matters because all three have different feeling,
opportunities, and limitations. So the advanced dancer should know them all.

Landing on heel in tango is not a normal walk. It has special technique
connected to the way one leads and uses his leg. It is a vital way to know.
Sometimes one who is stepping on the balls is using exactly the same
technique, but it is hidden. With heel-first walk it is highlighted.

Imagine this: one lands on the heel: weight is not transferred yet ( this is
the way ). This is phase one. Then there is phase two when the weight is
brought to be projected above the heel. Than it could be the phase three
when one transfers weight from heel to the ball. This could be the whole
step by itself ! Each of the phases gives birth to a variety of feeling,
influences, responses, and rhythmical plays..

Landing on the ball can be done similarly. Reaching of the leg forward,
stretching the leg forward can be done during both ways. Or not. Stepping
backward, landing on the heel extends leg straighter, on the toe - we can
bend the leg in a different way. 

Dancing on the heel is easier for a man dancing with a beginner woman - yes,
to stop her from running away which most of them do. A man is much more
stable to hold her from all this wobbling when he lands on the heel. Landing
on the ball - that is possible only with advanced women. It is much more
strain on the foot and should be used with caution, especially if one dances
20 hours a week. When I was a beginner, my feet hurt a lot until I have
mastered landing on the heel and on the flat foot technique. Now - I can
dance with ease for many hours - no pain ! I think this is the major reason
why the heel-first is better for beginners.

And it goes on and on.. 

Igor.

Landing on the heel first going backwards, Igor?  Sounds
like a lot of clopping to me.  Do you mean rolling back
onto the heel after landing with the ball of the foot?

I mean landing right on the heel. 

I agree, it is rare ..

Move your toe to the side, and you can do it even for long steps. For short
steps it is so easy.

That is for men.

For women it is even easier.

If you have high heels on..

Landing on the heel first going backwards, Igor?  Sounds
like a lot of clopping to me.  Do you mean rolling back
onto the heel after landing with the ball of the foot?

Interesting.  I'll have to experiment with that.

We're heel-first teachers, but our invited guest for a
pre-milonga lesson last night is a toe-first teacher.  So
he taught his way, which is fine because in earlier lessons
we've alway explained why we teach heel-first.  People can
make up their own minds.

Anyway, it turns out that the teacher dances toe-first
because he has heel spurs, so toe-first is less painful for
him.  One of my new beginning students has the same issue,
so I'll be working with him on toe-first.

For me it all goes back to dancing with the WHOLE body.  I
teach heel-first because it makes it much easier for people
to develop their kinesthetic sense of themselves.  I'd
rather that they focus on spinal movement and its
relationship to the standing leg and rest of the body.

I suspect that toe-first teachers may spend more time on
just walking straight with no turning than other teachers. 
Perhaps they have an audience that is patience enough to
handle that or who will actually work on walking exercises
by themselves.  If so, great.  Personally, I prefer to get
people out to a milonga as fast as possible and have them
feel as if they can successfully navigate, even if the
milonga has a lot of "gas molecules".

Hi,

Don't think how you arrive... Think were you start
your movement. Starting from the heel gives you earth
and strenght. But dont forget to use you whole foot
and the toes for stability while you transfer your
weight to the other leg. But finnaly arrive on your
heel. Feel the ground, and you feel it best with you
heel and than and not before start the next movement.

Where to place you weight? Place it on the heel as
soon as you can! Don't keep your weight on the toes
all the time. It might look elegent. But if you want
to look elegant use high heels and you can still place
your weight on the heel.

I have heard a story that there was a time where the
ladies in BA thought it is elegant to dance all the
time on their toes even wearing high heels. But if you
dance a lot and all the time on your toes it's quite a
strain to your metatarsal and the bones in the
metatarsal will break. And if they are once broken
they are week and they will break again... and
again... and you will never dance in your live again.
And there were a lot of Ladies at this time which
could not dance anymore. As soon as their danced the
bone was breaking again. They had a so called "tango
foot". So if you want to keep dancing use your heels!
Rest on them. If you want to look elegant wear high
heels. If you want to be comfortable wearing normal
shoos even more use your heels!

So if you want to dance a lot, and if you want to use
the ground and have a good connection with your
dancing partner keep your weight as much as you can on
the heels.

How you arrive? That's an embellishment... That's for
the public... for your ego... it's show ...  
the least important thing when you dance with someone.


Cheers
Eryk

Hello Eryk,

you said:

How you arrive? That's an embellishment... That's for
the public... for your ego... it's show ...
the least important thing when you dance with someone.

Don?t take this personally, please, but I find that entirely wrong. As 
Janis said earlier, it is all about feeling, and a big part of the 
feeling in tango is generated by how we place our feet on the floor. It 
makes a statement, actually, about our relationship with the floor. 
Arriving in the new place, when you finish the step, you greet the 
floor. It?s like a caress, or a handshake. And it does matter how you 
caress someone, or shake his or her hand. So the way you place your 
foot affects the way your weight arrives on your foot.
Check out this video, if you like (it?s Pablo & Noelia), and watch him 
placing his weight on his left foot at 1:48 min. That is a big part of 
his dance. Most people can hardly see that, but he can feel it, and I 
bet she can, too. Villa Urquiza is pretty big about walking softly, 
anyway, and arriving is the main part of that.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SizbMqQKfuw
Arriving well, placing your foot (and hers) with care and enjoying the 
process of settling your weight can make the woman sigh in your ear. 
Which makes it worth the effort.

Regards,
Andreas

Teaching Methodology for Women's technique has been presented by many
Argentine dancers in two major pathways  depending on their background. i.e.
Folk dance background or Modern dance background. Most of the time these
backgrounds produce very different concepts about the technique for women.
For me, Follower's technique requires activation via interaction with the
leader, and this determines whether her technique is nice or not. If any
tanguera has good technique they should look great whoever she dances with,
if not she will be depending particular partner to look good. No matter how
someone walks gracefully, when she is in her partner's arms, the real time
experiment begins for both of them.

Like any other culture, Argentine Tango is evolving and the gender issues
started have deeper impact on women's technique. New generation Argentine
teachers are not coming from folk dance background mainly as used to be.

Another variable is body structure of the female dancer who teach follower's
technique..(For instance, having short legs or long legs causes huge
separation  between  the concepts)

I'm sure that many other elements play role to define what concept is better
for someone.However, my suggestion for women is to find most suitable and
comfortable concept for your own body mechanics, not just some teacher says
that you have to do the way she does.

My favorite women's technique teachers who has amazing women technique
concepts have totally different concepts.
Such as Geraldine Rojas-Paludi, Mariana Montes, Nancy Louzan, Claudia
Codega, Melina Bruffman, Celine Ruiz

I hope this helps

The feeling is not generated by the placement of feet. The feeling 
generATES the placement of feet.

Let's not be mislead by a tradition of show-based instruction that 
mistakes visible effect for cause - the true cause is invisible feeling.

> placing your foot (and hers) with care ...

The placement does not make the sigh. The care makes the sigh... and the 
placement.

Well said. A girl's technique gains more from each minute of dancing with 
a good enough guy than from each hour of practicing ochos with a wall. 
It's really sad to see how much time, enthusiasm and money is wasted in 
women's technique workshops.

Exactly. Instead of worrying about the connection to the floor, I know
a lot of leaders who should be worrying about the connection with
their partner (and with the music).

If your follower doesn't think you connect properly, then do
something about that. If you lead properly (and thus listen
to your partner after the invitation, move together
for the entire duration of the step, and also negotiate
the end of a step), there's no way to land improperly
if you listen carefully and communicate continuously.
Your instinct will guide you, because...

...let's face it: we've been connecting with floors for most of
our life, one way or another, and most of us can do it in umpteen
different ways depending on what we want to achieve (stomping
when impersonating the formidable T-rex, or trying to get past
the parent's bedroom without making the wooden floor creak).

The same can't be said about connecting to a partner in an embrace, and
that's why many more people have *real* problems with that.

So if your partner tells you she feels as if she's on the other end of a 
bungee cord, listen to her and try to make the movement of
your upper body (which is what connects you to the follower) fluid, and
trust your instinct for the rest. The rest will (pun intended) follow,
and that includes what your feet are going to do. You muscle memory
knows what to do with them.

There's something about discussions about these minutiae
that makes me think there's a bit too much navel staring at times,
and to much worrying about how *we* look rather than how we can
dance in symbiosis with a partner and the music.

Hello Chris,

 >>Don't take this personally, please Andreas, but I find that entirely 
wrong.

generATES the placement of feet.<<

Semantics? Or are we talking about two different things? I was talking 
about the physical sensation that is generated by placing your weight 
on your foot. The dance is also a physical thing, is it not?
I suspect you are referring to an emotional state? That would indeed be 
the source of the movement, or its particular quality, and I would 
agree. How could anyone not?


 >>Let's not be mislead by a tradition of show-based instruction that
mistakes visible effect for cause - the true cause is invisible 
feeling.<<

I do not think I am, for I have received little such instruction...


 > placing your foot (and hers) with care ...

 >>The placement does not make the sigh. The care makes the sigh... and 
the

See above. Let?s clarify terms. And I still stand by my point.

On a further note, Alexis has a point in his post about the navel 
gazing. Usually I try to stay away from the semantic nitpicking and

Chan and Eugenia Park advocate heel-first. Chan (formerly of NASA) 
argues that the toe-first method throws a displeasing jolt into every 
step of your walk because the toe and/or ball of the foot hits the 
ground in a way that throws a wave of reverse energy into your forward 
motion. You have two separate actions happening to the foot: the 
toe/ball hits the ground to stop your forward motion and then the heel 
settles to give you back your balance... It's a bumpy feeling.

Walking forward with the heel first has a more efficient flow--less 
wasted energy. Smoother.

I just got back from the Park's workshop "Tango with the Buddha" in 
upstate New York. Very enjoyable class! Be sure to catch Eugenia and 
Chan if they teach in your area. You're in luck, Igor: they teach in 
So.California July 21-22.

     Ah yes, Igor, now I remember why I prefer Argentine
tango to ballroom dancing:  Some instructor isn't
constantly badgering you with all this sort of intricate
deconstructionist crap, and you get to just have fun
getting entranced with the music and embrace instead.  :)

     To tell you the truth, this is not something I think
about all that much.  Sitting here at my desk typing,
I imagine I go ball-first more on slower and more dramatic
stuff and heel-first or flat-foot on faster stuff, but
I couldn't swear for sure.  These days more and more of my
tango is right-brained instead of left-brained, thank God,
allowing me to simply enjoy the music, my partner, and my
sensory perceptions in general, instead of actively
plotting and scheming like a general in battle.

     It's kind of like how when you first learn to drive,
you struggle thinking about every little thing you do,
but when you're older, you often arrive at your
destination before you've really even thought about
having left the driveway.  But still, you're paying very
rapt attention (actually, some people never pay enough
attention while driving, but let's not go there)--but
it's right-brained, rather than left, ie. very sensitive
to perception, but reacting in the moment in the more
unconscious right-brained way of an animal instead of
the more usual for a human, highly self-aware, self-
conscious logically strategizing left-brain way.

     It's like a spell--and if either your dancing partner
on the floor or your companion in the passenger seat in
the car starts babbling, the spell is broken.

     This is why people who just casually babble away
about anything and everything while dancing don't have
the slightest idea what tango is about, by the way.  It's
not because if you break the no-talking-in-tango codigo
then haaaaa haaaaaa, you're not being authentic like
a porteno, nyah, nyah, nyah--it's because it distracts
from the right-brained trance and breaks the spell much
like a bubble bursting, bringing you back from your magic
unthinking tango escape and unceremoniously dumping you
with a thud right smack back into the mundane earthly
plane, DUH.

     I agree with this.  Regardless of whether you first
land on the ball or the heel, for the sake of your feet,
you should try to rest them as much as possible by
putting weight on your heels when you can.

     Corina talked about this in a lecture once.
Someone asked her if she liked dancing in high heels
or dance sneakers more, and she said high heels, by far,
that way she's got something to put her weight on.

     I absolutely cringe when I see women dancing in
dance sneakers staying up on the balls of their feet
the whole time.  And they wonder why their feet fall
apart.

     Often during a milonga women will complain to
me about how their feet are hurting.  I suggest that
they try putting weight on their heels as much as they
can while dancing when they have the opportunity to do
so to take the stress off their feet, and more often
than not, they just go  *blink*  *blink*  and look at me
curiously like I'm from Mars, or have a tinfoil hat on
my head.

Hi,
I will be visiting BsAs from 8/12 to 8/25. Does anyone know of a good guest house where I could stay during that time? Or, alternatively, know of someone that would be willing to share an apartment w/ me for two weeks? The apartment I found is near the milongas and has two bedrooms.

Holla,

I did not said that embellishments ar not important.
I just claim that what the base of your free leg does
is an embellishment.
The TOE OR HEAL FIRST in the projection of the free
leg is an embellishment!
With your free leg you are doing embellishments. I
start a step with a projection. And I can choose to
project toe or heal first. The projected leg can go
for the contact with the floor, but I also can
withdraw the projection. If I want to look elegant i
probably will try to emulate Pablos Footwork. But note
he dances Di Sarli and the Villa Urquiza style goes
fine with it! Dance Pugliese the same way and you will
look a bit out of place!


Meanwhile, your weight rests on the other leg (not the
free one) and if you want to have stability you have
to rest on you HEEL and you are using the toes to
balance. Try standing on your toes and doing an lapis!
Good luck!

Fantastic video! I had actually the pleasure to take
several class by Pablo Rodriguez this spring in the
UK. Wonderful dancer. Thanks for posting this video 
here. If you look closely you will see that Pablo
varies if he places his heels or his toes of the FREE
LEG on the floor first. While going forward he first
contacts the floor with the heel, while going
backwards usually with the toes.

And thanks to all for this very interesting discussion
about how to walk in the tango!


Cheers
Eryk

I am reluctant to further argue the point, but it is part of the step, 
isn?t it? The way you move your leg is part of the way you step. What I 
was mainly talking about is the moment of connecting and the subsequent 
process of letting the weight settle on the foot.
What you said sounded to me a bit like it doesn?t matter what the 
leg/foot does. I think it does. The Aesthestics of the movement 
generate a feeling - it feels different to me if I move my leg in 
different ways. I don?t want to argue hen and eggs things, and cause 
and effect are not always clear here.

> The TOE OR HEAL FIRST in the projection of the free
> leg is an embellishment!

Then your definition of embellishment differs from mine a bit. I?d 
refer to the post of Tom about heel or toe, as he said all that needs 
to be said. Toe or heel first have, or can have, technical effects (and 
causes).

> With your free leg you are doing embellishments. I

True. But it does have an effect on the subsequent movement, so for me 
it is an integral part of the chosen step.

I think you have workshops vids on your channel of Osvaldo Zotto. He?s 
one of the most elegant dancers ever, but he does it with quite a 
different way of walking. Hard to choose who to emulate...

I agree 100% that you shouldn?t dance the same way to different music. 
I?d like to see Pablo and Noelia dance Pugliese. I think there?s 
nothing on youtube yet.

You?re not putting more weight on the heel than on the ball of the 
foot, are you? If you mean using the heel as a stabilizer (how much 
actual weight can differ according to the situation), that?s fine with 
me.

Yup, I saw the vid on your channel. I like him. Very impressive how one 
so young can dance in such a "mature" fashion.

>

> about how to walk in the tango!

I hope I wasn?t coming across as overly direct, but as you seem to live 
in Germany you probably don?t need to many "IMHO" s and such. ;-)
The thing with discussions like this is that it?s quite difficult to be 
entirely clear about complex things like movement without resorting to 
the occasional demonstration. I usually try to stay out of it and just 
do my stuff.

Cheers,
Andreas

I'll try a definition of a good enough guy:
A bad dancer tries to impress the follower showing how great HE is
A good dancer lets her feel how amazing SHE can dance.

But this reminds me somehow of two eurythmics songs,
something with sisters and man needed or so...

Actually, a women's technique can improve with
inexperienced dancers if she consciously works at it.  The
problem with dancing with only good dancers is that the
good dancers end up compensating for her and she never
learns what she needs to work on.  BTW, I prefer the word
"inexperienced" to "bad" because I find the latter to be
more of an attitude than dance ability.

For example, I would consciously work on my grounding with
a really big guy that would tend to pull women off axis a
lot.  (He had problems processing information from an
accident, so there was some tolerance.)  When I danced with
him, I refused to let him do that to me.  I got my grouding
practice in and he got to work on his listening skills.

It's really sad to see how much time, enthusiasm and money
is wasted in women's technique workshops.

--

Well Chris, if women's technique workshops involved
practicing ochos with a wall, then you would be dead on
right. The only thing practicing ochos with a wall (or
barre) would improve is the women's
hang-on-to-the-guy-instead-of-use-her-own-balance
technique. Oh, and maybe consquently, improve her
sitting-and-watching-instead-of-dancing-at-the-milonga
technique. 

Fortunately, I haven't seen that sort of unteaching in many
years. Either you have no clue about what goes on in
women's technique workshops Chris, or you live in a tango
backwater where teaching methodology hasn't changed in over
a decade. Either way, you aren't really qualified to
comment on this, are you?

For the followers, in the unlikely event that you find
yourselves in a technique workshop and the teacher tells
you to practice ochos with a wall, walk out and demend your
money back. You are being cheated. Then post the name of
the teacher on the list, so the rest of us can avoid him.

Anyone (man or woman) who has been dancing more than a few
weeks should be able to practice their ochos alone, in the
middle of the floor, and maintain balance and control. If
you can't, then you are not ready to dance with a partner.
But don't be discouraged. Work at it at home for 20 minutes
a day, and you will be able to do it in a week or less. If
you are not willing to invest 20 minutes a day into
improving your balance and control, then why would anyone
want to dance with you? 

Dancing with an experienced partner will not do anything to
improve your balance or control. You have to work alone to
develop those skills. Most men (except Chris) seem to
figure this out on their own, but it seems that many women
think they need a more experienced partner to practice.
These women never seem to improve, do they? They just sit
and complain about the shortage of men, while the newbies
who are willing to work quietly surpass them (in short
order), and then get all the dances.

Laura,

Gee, it depends upon what you're looking for. It could be for technique
lessons, but you got technique, kid. It could also be for the best
techniques for teaching women's technique. There are videos available that
tend to be better for one than the other.

In other words, there may be videos teaching "Women's Technique" that are
very well taught, using interesting tips and techniques to teach. But they
may not be demonstrating the most interesting information about the subject.
Result: The student learns a lot of not so good stuff and learns it very
easily and well.

There may be other videos, maybe not even "teaching videos", that
demonstrate unique, creative, thoughtful, and most of all, musical
techniques that may not have a very interesting teaching methodology.
Result: The student learns to dance more expressively and develops her own
style based upon watching, really watching what these women do and then
learning to slip it into their own dance. At all times being under control
of who sees or feels their movements.

Then  there are those who can do both.

I'm sure the list can offer many examples of the first two.
I'm interested in the ones who can do both.

All the best,

Robin

I always find it amusing when men argue about women's
technique and the problems they have as they learn. 
Comments from the ladies?

As a recent thread attested, what was true in the early days of tango in BsAs, and is still true today, is that lots of men tango dancers are learning to follow, ie. learning "women's" technique. A recent segment of Alex Krebs' weekly men's practica here in Portland was focused completely on women's technique. 
 
In addition, many men on this list are teachers, which includes teaching women. 
 
Regardless that most men's experience base in "follower's" technique is much less extensive than that of most women, I think it's entirely appropriate for men to discuss women's technique and the problems of learning same. 
 
That said, I agree it's better when we come off as less than absolute experts ...

Besides, men are those who "feel" the result of women's technique workshops.
It is not always pleasant.

I believe some men are much better judges of women's technique than women.
Just because they dance with so many women and know what it is about - good
technique.

But no more. Men hardly are able to tell why the technique of one woman is
better than another one. It is up to a knowledgeable teacher.

Yes Sean, we read a lot on Tango-L about all the new, modern methods you Americans have
devised to teach Tango. Strange though that, so far, it hasn't produced a single world 
class Tango dancer. And, if you read the recent interview with Tete, I'm sure you noticed
his 'thumbs down' to the standard of Tango in the US. No surprise there. I'm pretty sure the 
"tango backwater" of Europe could beat you hands-down. And things don't change much in
 Buenos Aires - is that also a "tango backwater"? Sean, considering the standard of Tango in 
the US, your arrogance is amazing.

Dear HongKong Keith and all othet List Tangueros,

Nice one, Keith...! Great stuff!
But... methinks there will now be a litany of flaming coming your way... good luck!

[NB For all you paranoics over there... this posting is NOT anti-American! ;-)))]

However, although I have also heard similar reportS (I emphasise the plural) about the standard of US tango (and I should say that some of these 'reports' are not just from the tango plebs/'rank-and-file' but from the higher echelons), I have to say that it is difficult although not incorrect to generalise. There are good and bad dancers in all countries/races/cultures, good and bad teachers in all countries/races/cultures. Just because there has been no production (your assertion... as personally, I don't know) of so-called 'world class' tangueros from the USA, doesn't mean that there are no superb, decent or half-decent tangueros out there.

Problem is (and I completely agree with you here) that what we tend to read from the Americans (nothing personal, Yanks, just an observation) are reams and reams of in-depth, unnecessary diatribes of at what precise angle should the little toe (for example) be deviated to execute a particular 'move'. Also, we get cockeyed methods of 'the best ways to teach', nutty exercises and how to invite someone to dance.

It's as if the natural extrapolation is to approach the American military to devise some robotic, laser-guided, bionic suit that will precision-enhance what we do on the dance floor and indeed how we approach our prospective targets (perhaps some sort of infra-red implant in our eyeball that will attract a target on the other side of the salon to dance).

Too much analysis.

I say, bloody hell... just dance!
 
Very best wishes

Well said, Jay. There's no such thing as women's technique. All the technique of the woman is the man's too.

Correct. I live in a tango backwater deep in provincial England.

I learned (and dance) elsewhere. The women's workshops referred to are those such as I (a guy who learned as a woman) took from big-name step peddlers* that I'm sure you've heard of.

Thank you Caroline. It's nice to know that someone else
figured this out. Would you have learned faster if your
early teachers had told you this right from the start,
instead of waiting for you to figure it out on your own?

>From the other responses to my plain, common sense comment,
I am beginning to think that there is some merit to Chris's
opinion about tango teachers. At least some seem to prefer
to create perpetual students, rather than competent
dancers.

I hope we all can see the problem with the wall method, and
hopefully, the more imaginative people can see that it can
be solved by having the student do the same exercise
standing 3 feet away from the wall. Would one of the
teachers still using it please explain the hidden benefits
of the wall that outweigh the obvious problems?

When I started learning tango, I was told that it would
take 5 years to become competent in the dance. That was a
commonly held belief in this area in 1995. I dutifully took
classes and attended practicas for 5 years, and even
struggled through some milongas. At around 5 years of
experience, I was asked to teach by the same group that
taught me.

If your goal is to produce world class dancers Keith, I
wish you luck, but don't quit your day job. My goal is to
put as many people as possible onto a social dance floor
with the tools they need to enjoy themselves, give their
partners an enjoyable dance, and not interfere with anyone
else's enjoyment of the dance. Today, it takes me 6 months
or less to raise most students to the level I was at after
5 years. If it ever takes a whole year, I'll tell that
student to find another teacher.

When I took the 5 year tango track, it included lots of
steps, the D8CB, ochos against the wall, and a whole bunch
of other counter-productive exercises. But at that time, it
was the state of the art for teaching tango. Today, any
teacher who tells their students that it will take 5 years
to become competent in the dance might be hopelessly
incompetent themselves, or could be con artist out to scam
as much money as possible from their students. (I just put
that last part in for Chris ;)

Teachers, if you haven't changed the way you teach in the
last 5 years, you aren't doing your job. Examine everything
you do, and figure out a way to do each thing a little
better. Repeat this exercise a few times a year for the
rest of your career.

Students, try as many different teachers as you can find,
right from the start. In Pittsburgh, Trini and I host a
free weekly milonga with a free beginner?s class. We have
invited every teacher in the city to take turns teaching
the class, so that all of the students and teachers can get
to know each other. In addition, we hope that the various
teachers will attend each other's classes, and learn more
about teaching.

Not exactly.  Women need to be more a of generalist than a
man does, simply because of what she gets asked to do at a
milonga.  She needs to learn a much wider range of motion
much faster than a man does.  I was reminded of that last
night as I was led to do high boleos and linear boleos
(very well, I should add), even I really don't care for
those things.

The more I learn as a follower, the more impressed I am
with how good the top women in tango must be to handle the
range of styles that they do.

Well, yes, I know women who already know the dance even before taking the

Message-ID: <50048.1184523921@tangohk.com>

Sean, Caroline and others,

I think you're all missing the point of practicing Ochos with hands against a wall.
You shouldn't be leaning on the wall and I've never seen it taught that way. The
purpose of the exercise is just  to keep the hands against the wall while doing the turns. 
In that way the body stays facing the wall while the hips rotate, i.e. you twist at the waist.
The problem with beginners practicing Ochos without the wall is that they tend to turn the
complete body, including shoulders. When they do the same with a partner, the result is
disastrous. There's nothing wrong with the exercise, just the way it's taught and used.

Same thing with practicing Giros around a tall stool or column. The idea is not to lean on 
the stool or column, but just to keep the hands touching. Again, the student is forced to 
rotate at the waist and keep the body facing the centre. It's an excellent exercise if used 
properly. 

Once the student has learned to keep her body facing her partner during Ochos and Giros,
the wall, stool and column can be dispensed with and she can concentrate on balance. Don't 
blame the exercises. Either blame the teachers for giving incorrect instruction or blame
yourselves for not paying enough attention to what the teacher wanted you to do - not
unusual in beginner students.

Of course, if you have a partner to practice with - that's best of all.

Keith, HK

Message-ID: <BAY121-F143D36A72E55F0050678CDD4FF0@phx.gbl>

Hello all,
back a year ago, I happened to see Mariana Montes wear shoes which have 
soles which literally flex back all the way under her foot - very soft, 
looked like they had regular leather or suede soles, but the inside was not 
made sturdy like in regular shoes, but of some resin-like material. They 
looked fantastic for dancing as they probably provide great connection with 
the floor, but I've never seen them sold anywhere.
Designs looked like Comme il Faut, but all the shoes from Comme In Faut have 
less flexible soles (flexible but not that flexible).
Any ladies (or men) out there who know where to get shoes like that?
Thanks,
Svetlana.

Having just had to relearn how to lead front ochos from scratch, and
because I'm taking Florencia's Fundamentals class here in Minneapolis, I
may have had more recent experience with ocho pedagogy than many or even
most people here.

The benefits to the wall method are several:

-- one learns how to do ochos keeping a constant distance from an
external reference point
-- done close enough to the wall, one has to keep the chest facing the
wall and dissociate the hips to get around
-- one can practice rolling the contact patch of the connection from one
side of the chest to the other during the pivot

The key is having the discipline not to use the hands for balance at
all, to lightly brush the wall as you move in each direction.

Before anyone gets the idea that I'm anti-no-wall-ochos, this exercise
didn't become relevant (eg, possible to execute even poorly) to me until
I was able to do 5 or 6 180 degree no-wall ochos in a row.  No wall is
essential for learning to chose and execute the precise amount of pivot
you want.  There's a practice pattern I learned in my first year, that
has you take one step forward, and then do front ochos of 45, 90, 90,
135, 225, 270, 270 and 135 degrees -- wash, rinse, repeat 15 to 20 times
a day for 6 months and see how good you get.

Sounds like you're describing super-flexible, ballroom dancing shoes. These
shoes are very flexible, but allow the foot to go into a ballet point which
is not typical of tango dancing. They also have much less support and offer
little help with stability and balance.

Most of us dance tango for hours at a time in classes, practicas and
milongas. Our feet need a little help. Yes, the feet get stronger as time
goes on, but a supportive shoe is the most effective tool for good balance.
A good shoe gives you comfort, fashion and stability. A good shoe helps
dancers gain confidence, while never having to think about their feet.

I spent 8 weeks in BA last June, July and August.

In the beginning, everyone needs to adjust to BA.  I did indeed run into
one of those unforgiving types, who actually had earned the right to be
judgemental (she is very sick now, I hear).  As I recall, my lead needed
considerable firming up and I needed to slow way down, faults common
enough everywhere in the  world.  In the end I was doing well enough.

That being said, I've seen Miles dance.  He'll do fine, probably better
than I did.  I never went anywhere in BA harder to navigate than the
Friday night Mercury Cafe milonga with 200+ people in it.

Actually, I will go out on a limb and say that if you stay in the lanes,
navigation in Denver is better than many BA milongas.  There aren't
nearly as many inconsiderate jerks rushing forwards and backwards in the
line of dance to open up 3 to 4 times the amount of space the rest have
to be content with.

Sure you can! 
6 months dancing every night (7/7) is dancing 180 times in half a year!
Compared with those who'd just dance once a week these would take 3,5 years to arrive at the dacing experience. And those just dancing once a month: 15 years!

Asking someone "who long have you been dancing for" to find out about his/her dancing level is the most stupid way to start a conversation on the dance floor. Those who ask me, even if they actually want to compliment me, I can't take to seriously any more.

Enjoy dancing, no matter the number of times before!

Each year we get 1 or 2 young men (in their 20s) who become competent social
tango dancers (close embrace) within 6 months. I believe it is possible for
some men to achieve basic skills of partner connection, connection with the
music, and navigation, all while having a good balanced walk, within 6
months. Their repertoire is mosly walking, rock steps (some turning),
several variations on the ocho cortado and basic back ochos. Their dance is
simple but with good basic tango skills. On the other hand if instruction
focuses on teaching giros, ganchos, boleos, volcadas, colgadas and the like,
you can have dancers with 2-3 years tango experience who still can't walk
with grace and balance to the music.

My 2 cents here...

Illinois> tango dancers (close embrace) within 6 months. I believe it is possible for

It depends quite a bit on the motivation of the students. In Hungary, learning dancing is at the same level as going to the movies or eating out, which means that many people simply doesn't have any motivation to actually _learn_ tango well or even to use it at a milonga. I have to work very hard to create an environment on my classes that makes people at least curious about a milonga, so they continue dancing after the first few months and practice outside my 90-minutes-per-week tango classes.

Illinois> months. Their repertoire is mosly walking, rock steps (some turning),
Illinois> several variations on the ocho cortado and basic back ochos. 

I'd be out of business, if people learnt only this in half a year (even though wouldn't ever teach colgadas in the first year - counting the average 3-5 hours per week tango involvement). The tango scene in Hungary was dominated by stage dancers during its initial expansion, so people rarely dance simple at the milongas (you can't even try: some women don't even understand if you lead steps less than half a meter...). This makes dancers of beginner-level knowledge feel completely incompetent and drives them towards fancy stuff. A great number of beginners choose to take lessons with stage dancers because they are teaching "more than walks and ochos".

Illinois> you can have dancers with 2-3 years tango experience who still can't walk
Illinois> with grace and balance to the music.

I wish that would be the case. But my experience shows that you can teach a lot of stuff early and still have a good - apparent - level of dancing. These people usually use quite a lot of muscle strength to do what they do, so they aren't too comfortable to dance with, however, from the outside they are quite adept dancers. Since most locals don't know what they are missing, they didn't develop the need for better connection and more subtleness. :(

Cheers,
Aron

Ron,

I have wrote a long letter trying to explain why I think 5 year is a good
estimation for a dance which can be called tango.

Then I thought for a moment and as a result I am not sending it. 

Yes, you are right, Sean and Ron. It is possible to learn dancing decent
tango in 6 months. I have my own proofs of that.

Igor.
PS 
Keith,
Yes, you are right ! After 7 years of dancing I do not think I am ready for
Buenos Aires. That is the reason why I have not been there yet.

I find your general discussion style a bit aggressive for any forum, however, you are quite right about the "unforgiving" nature of Argentine women. I am a tango professional with over 15 years of dancing behind me. In Argentina -, people usually thought I am a local (I guess I look like an Argentine) so I could - at least - avoid the "foreigners are bad dancers" stereotype, nevertheless, it wasn't easy for me to get dances in the beginning (cabeceo isn't just having your eyes pop out when you want to dance with someone) and found that dancers of different styles will not mix easily, so if you learnt quite a lot of nuevo, expect that the "traditional" folks will turn you down. Nuevo dancers are more open to others, but they expect a soft lead, excellent navigation skills and great rythm and a lot of play with innocent-looking but sometimes quite complex moves on that four squarefoots you have. You need more than a basic knowledge of the steps for some basic combinations to even have a dance.

IMO While all the above is true, it is only true to BsAs. In every other part of the world people are different, cultural background is different, there is no _real_ need for cabeceo ("everyone knows everyone else" scenario), women are eager to dance with anyone (tango dancers are not so many) and this Argentine mechanism to sort out the less better dancers*** is considered extremely rude. So, mediocre level dancing in the general public, too much show/less subtleness remains because there is no mechanism in place to change it! Personal motivation to become a really good dancer is only present a 1-5% of the general public (It is higher if you are Italian... :) ) and even including the teacher's personal charm will not change the situation considerably, as people usually don't quit their jobs or devote all their free time for dancing.

***cabeceo (selection by women, actively punishing forced (direct) invitations - of course, except if you are one of those every woman wants to dance with), coupled with tandas and cortinas (where a cortina means that you MUST leave the floor and change partner - of course, if you are experiencing so much chemistry that you both want to have another go that's maybe OK, make sure the girls boyfriend is not near though), the "right" to leave during a dance (no mercy-dances), women being extremely picky and dancing with only good dancers even if they have to sit all night.

This system is quite well developed, obviously it builds on general gender-related behaviour. Guys compete, girls choose. Simple, but works. Modern European/N-American society tends to use the "equal rights" (for men/women) principle in everyday life, which leads to the elimination of this... (Ladies, tell me which one of you would gladly tell a guy who is eager, nice, but is a no-go, that he has no chance? How would you tell it? (my experience: a no from a women here is usually all too soft, even if it meant stonewalling) Guys, which one of you normally want a situation where you have to work truly hard to just break even against a lot of other men, who has more experience, more control and more success in what they do, on a field where you have little or no experience, and is obviously not something you learn to do overnight and facing a plethora of disappointing experiences?)

Cheers,
Aron

 Hi Aron,

 Sorry if you find my writing style aggressive. Probably due to 25 years working on constuction sites around the world and
 dealing with some very tough contractors. Finally gave up that life, settled in Hong Kong and became a full-time Tango
 instructor - with some Ballroom and Latin thrown in. I make a pretty good living but I agree with you - if I only taught my
 students walking, rock steps and various ochos for 6-months, I'd also be out of business and, in my case, back to construction
 work. 

 People will never learn Tango unless they keep coming to the classes [despite what Chris, UK says] so you have to keep them
 interested until they become hooked. If that means teaching beginners Barridas, Ganchos and Boleos after about 3-months  - 
 fair enough. And, if I don't do it, even in a small place like HK there are 5 or 6 other couples who will. But it's still the visiting
 Show Tango instructors who teach the really wild stuff - and those classes are always packed!

 Keith, HK

IMHO, if a guy can competently walk with ease and elegance, perform turns to 
both sides and navigate the dance floor and lead his partner to dance as he 
does all this, he is already and accomplished dancer and is probably already 
teaching his own classes. I don't know who these 6 month wonders are. I'd 
like to see them and I'd love to see the methodology their teachers use.

While it is true that there are phenomenal dancers who can achieve greatness 
in short order (think Chicho Frumboli), I think they are a minuscule 
minority. I don't agree with teaching raw beginners to do ganchos, barridas, 
colgadas, volcadas or flashy boleos and sacadas. It's a very bad idea, this 
kind of teaching philosophy produces the worst dancers that one sees in the 
social dance floor. These are the people about whom the biggest rants 
against "show tango" are directed.

I don't know about the proficient dancers that some people in this forum are 
talking about. I have not seen them so I cannot talk about them. However, I 
do know that there are teachers out there who have very nice personalities 
and are very complementary of their students progress and ability. These are 
very nice people and very supportive of their charges. They are doing what 
they think is right and in some ways they are correct. It's very important 
to be supportive and encouraging. The only problem is that in their efforts, 
they convince their students (and themselves I guess..) that they are indeed 
good dancers and quite proficient. Alas, to the knowledgeable observer this 
is simply not so. This is equally bad for those teaching choreographed back 
sacadas, and flying boleos as it is for those who teach plodding under the 
guise of "close embrace".

In my years of dancing and teaching since the early '90s, I've come to the 
conclusion that the tango is not easy to learn or to teach. It is simple, 
but not easy. People can take lessons for years from good teachers, and 
still struggle to dance simply, elegantly and with the music. Yes, there are 
exceptions, but that is all they are. And yes, when these people go to BsAs, 
they find out just how woefully inadequate their dancing really is and how 
judgmental and picky the Portenos/as can be... A rude awakening indeed. 
OTOH, there is good dancing in the US and anyone who says different is just 
talking from limited experience or just lying. In any of the larger 
festivals around the US, one can find many very good dancers. Actually, you 
don't even need to do go to those festivals. Just come to Atlanta during a 
week when we have several milongas and come to dance. You'll see for 
yourself that there is an excellent level of dancing right here in the USA.

Cheers,

Manuel

What she never learns is stuff needed only for partnering bad dancers. 
That's a problem for the teachers selling it, but for the girl?

Not at all. Because, as you said, she only dances only with good dancers. 
Where, incidentally, she can naturally learn all she needs to become as 
good herself.

Quite why any girl feels she should "consciously work at it", goodness 
only knows. That's the guy's job. The girl's job is to have a good time. 
No guy who respects girls would have it otherwise.

Chris

I had to laugh, Chris, that was actually funny but seriously though, Trini 
has a point. A minority of leaders at milongas are very good, the rest of 
them are "inexperienced" or just haven't gotten advanced yet. In which case, 
we could ignore them and sit all night or dance with them and work harder at 
maintaining our balance and axis while they get practice. If we don't do 
that, then we look like fools on the floor not to mention very ungraceful.  
It's not as though milongas in North America  are big enough that we can 
choose to dance only with the best leaders at all times. So, we make do.

On the other hand.....if Trini accepts a dance with
big, off-balance guy and compensates for his lack of
skills,  then he goes bouncing off the dancefloor,
very proud of the fact that he danced so beautifully
with "the best follower" in the room and it is the
rest of us who are bad followers.  What is his
incentive to get better?  Sorry, but we have too many
of those guys on the dance floors and on Tango-L
already.  I can agree to be ' more grounded' as long
as it is no different than how I would dance with a
good leader.  If he is pushing and pulling, I take my
hand  away.  He understands that.  Even the rankest
beginner should not be pulling me off axis.  If he is
off beat, I can dance to the beat  until he gets it. 
If he is truly awful, I can suggest we sit down and
watch the dancers.  

Several folks have posted here recently about how
unforgiving the portenas are about dancing with
tourists.  No, they are not.  However, they will not
dance with a bad dancer out of charity....unless, of
course, they are bad followers - and there are plenty
of those in Buenos Aires, too.  Some of those couples
even enter the Campeonato Mundial.

"The purpose of the exercise is just to keep the hands
against the wall while doing the turns. In that way the
body stays facing the wall while the hips rotate, i.e. you
twist at the waist. The problem with beginners practicing
Ochos without the wall is that they tend to turn the
complete body, including shoulders."

Keith is right that most beginners will turn as a block if
they are asked by an inadequate teacher to do ochos in the
middle of the floor. We don't use the exercise to teach the
ocho as a step. We use to help the students learn to
disassociate the ribs from the hips. The problem with
providing the wall crutch is that the students will
invariably use their arms to restrain their ribs while
their hips turn. They don't have to lean on the wall to do
this. It only requires a very light touch with the
fingertips, and tension in the arms, shoulders and back to
restrain the ribs. That tension is disastrous when the
student tries to do ochos with a partner.

Keith's error is in thinking and teaching that
disassociation is created when "you twist at the waist".
Movement of the body occurs at joints. There is no waist
joint. Disassociation of the hips and ribs is only possible
by twisting the spine, particularly the lumbar spine. This
is not a pointless semantic distinction. When you think of
twisting the spine instead of the waist, it becomes
immediately apparent that creating tension in the back is
counterproductive.

Good teaching becomes an exercise in problem solving. A
problem with having beginning students execute ochos in the
middle of the floor is that they tend to turn as a block.
Having them execute ochos against a wall solves the
turning-as-a-block problem, but it defeats the purpose of
the exercise, and it creates worse problems. Our solution
is to use exercises that teach the students to disassociate
the hips and ribs and to sense the positions of their ribs
and hips. (When they start, most students can't feel the
difference between turning as a block and spiraling.) Once
they develop that sense, we introduce the ocho exercise. We
might introduce the ocho exercise later than some teachers,
but I am sure our students become proficient much more
quickly than students who got a "head start" by working
with a wall.

I suspect that a lot of tango teachers don't put much
effort into learning how to teach. They use the same
methods that they think their teachers used. The problem
with that, as Keith pointed out, is that they were "not
paying enough attention to what the teacher wanted you to
do ? not unusual in beginner students." 

If teaching your students as well as you were taught is
good enough for you, maybe teaching isn't your calling.
Some dancers (Salas and Gavito at least) are held as sacred
by the community, because they have defined the highest
level of dancing tango. IMHO, there are not yet any
teachers who qualify for deification. The art of teaching
tango is still in its infancy.

I dont know...it's damned if you do, damned if you don't.

I could go into a lengthy explanation of that but i think we all know what I 
mean. In Buenos Aires, where I have a ton of choices of leaders to choose 
from, I would be much more discerning but in North America, when the choices 
are so few and there's about 20 great followers per one good leader, the 
competion is overwhelming.

So, I do lower my standards a bit and try to make the best of it. The thing 
is that intermediate leaders do improve, especially if they're bitten by the 
tango bug. If I am friendly with them now, then I've got a much better 
chance of dancing with them when they finally become good leaders.

The big question is how can leaders become better dancers if we don't give 
them a chance?

It's a very grey muddy area with way too many variables for me to black and 
white about this subject.

In the case of Salas, he defined the highest level of the dance for a

Well, Chris, I certainly hope that your opinion is in the distinct minority.
  Unfortunely, I'm not sure that is true.
   
  Back in the 40s and 50s Arthur Murray advised his female students
  that they were just as responsible for making any dance they accept 
  a good experience, as were their male partners. So, they needed
  to learn certain things. 
   
  I have been looking at some West Coast Swing information, and one
  of the oldest, prominant teachers organiztions of that dance, which
  I find to be very similar in spirit to Argentine Tango, teaches
  that WCS is a 50/50 partnership.
   
  Women do not get better by osmosis. Someone has to point out to 
  them that they should be doing something differently. Whatever you
  do for them, they will not learn to do, either for themselves, or for their
  partners.

What she never learns is stuff needed only for partnering bad dancers. 
That's a problem for the teachers selling it, but for the girl?

Not at all. Because, as you said, she only dances only with good dancers. 
Where, incidentally, she can naturally learn all she needs to become as 
good herself.

Quite why any girl feels she should "consciously work at it", goodness 
only knows. That's the guy's job. The girl's job is to have a good time. 
No guy who respects girls would have it otherwise.

Amazing. Tell me, Trini: do you also recommend bad sex for practice?

Hi Dani,

Italy is not like the rest of the world. (Like you didn't
already know that.) Even many of the traveling Porteno
teachers agree that the Italians are among the best tango
dancers in the world. Maybe this is because Italian men are
so competative with each other. Maybe Italian women prefer
good dancers. Whatever the reason, what works in Italy
doesn't work in the rest of the world.

American men don't compete to be the best dancers. They
compete to have the biggest SUV. Maybe because American
women prefer la viva rica to la dulce vita. OK, that
stereotype might not be fair to the tiny minority of tango
dancers. But it may be fairly applied to most of our
population. And at some level those cultural values still
influence our tango dancers. 

In a culture that values surplus quantity, teachers must
work very hard to inspire their students to strive for
quality. On the other hand, teachers who are out to sell a
step a week can make an easy profit in the short run, at
the cost of destroying our dance environment.

Sean

P.S. Don't put too much stock in Keith's "world class"
ideal. Budwiser beer and Armani suits are both world class
products. But I'm not ready to abandon Guiness or Zegna. I
suppose I am one of those rare people who prefer quality
over brand names.

Good teaching is an exercise in not problem creating. It's first 
responsibility is simply not to sabotage the natural development process.

Quite. A problem created only by bad teaching.

Well, you could instead try the solution that has been working fine for 
most of the last 100 years. The learner partners not with thin air but 
with another human being - one who can already dance. The embrace keeps 
them together in a way that means, apropos ochos, your "turn as a block" 
just does not happen. Pivoting arises naturally from the embrace as 
something fully shared by the couple, rather than simply commanded by one 
and executed by the other.

It may be better to _say_ it that way if it invokes the appropriate
muscles as an intuitive response (don't know if this is true or not
but I can take your word for it). However you are not really
spine-twisting to dissociate. There is no waist joint, true, but there
are specific muscles that generally go between your hips and your
ribcage and accomplish the twisting by contraction.

My understanding is that if you twist only your upper body so that
your right shoulder rotates forward and to the left (from your POV),
or, equivalently, when you twist only your lower body so that your
left knee/leg rotates forward and to the right, you involve mainly the
right external oblique, the left internal oblique, and to a smaller
degree the rectus abdominis and the left spinal erectors. So the main
movers are nowhere near the spine, and the spine errectors do not
twist it, even though the spine may get a twist in it as a
_consequence_ of the contraction of the obliques.

With best regards,

The way you write that, it implies all women have this instinct for
tango.  This like saying all women have an instinct for belly dance. 
Yah, right.

Yes, I've met women who are superb dancers after a couple of months of
tango.  The key is that they already had balance, didn't have to learn
new ways of moving their body, so all they really needed to work on is
their following skills.

I wonder what you would say to some of the women I have met who've spent
decades not moving their bodies and decide they want to learn tango. 
This is not an easy place for them be be in, and the difficulties seem
to be 2: much of their musculoskeletal system doesn't work as designed,
and they have strange notions of what tango movement actually consists
of.

Good luck trying to get them to learn tango by osmosis.

Great points, Sean!

I have observed that American men, in general (with exceptions, of 
course) seem to prefer to appear casual and "down-to-earth" instead 
of dashing and debonaire.  It shows in tango.  Why do you think this 
is?  Is it the historical heritage of the country?  Is it the pop culture?

This is disappointing...I really like dashing and debonaire dandies, 
in life and in tango.

Argentine culture is so much more formal than the American culture... 
Now I am getting all teary-eyed and sentimental...

[back to reality]

About the world-class dancers - neither America, not any other 
country other than Argentina seems to have managed to produce one 
yet.  If you are not Argentine, you cannot be a world-class tango 
dancer and might as well forget about it because the world of tango, 
with all the "classy" dancing,  begins and ends in Argentina.:)  This 
is an absolute.  But it helps all the other people in the world to be 
free just to dance.

Best,

Nina

People who like to debunk the need to study and practise the technical 
skills in tango often
compare it to making love --- as if sex is completely biological and 
instinctive, which it is
not, and the reason why we need experts to study the subject.

Generally followers have a more difficult task than leaders, because 
they have to adapt to a
range of movement and musical styles, plus they can only influence the 
leader in small ways
but not turn into back-leaders.  It is a game of "reaction" not 
"action", yet many enjoyable
and demanding games are like that -- fishing, rock climbing, hang 
gliding etc.

In our discussions, some people have described following as "surfing a 
wave".  You can
jump on a big sea wave and hope it is going to give you a big thrill, 
but it will take solid
following skill to stay on the sweet spot of that wave, and 200% 
concentration to add
embellishment to the ride.  Given that the big kahuna appears only 
rarely, most of the time
the surfers practise on the smaller, less thrilling ones, but those 
efforts are never
considered to be wasted.

Hi Nancy,

Your assessment might be correct if I allowed myself to be
improperly danced with.  But that is not the case, and my
partner knew it.

But it was well before I became a teacher that I made a
point of practicing things like balance and sensitivity
with the inexperienced men.  So with guys who tended to use
their arms, I moved faster so that they couldn't use their
arms (sorta' like beating them to the punch).  For guys who
bounced, I worked on being smoother instead (I danced open
at that time).  It turned out that some of the guys picked
up on what their own problems were as my own problems
disappeared.

That's how I learned to become a much better follower.

Trini de Pittsburgh

P.S.  Since I pretty much dance with everyone at some point
(I am a teacher and community-builder after all), I use
other devices to signal to guys how well they are doing,
such as in what music I choose to dance with them, whether
I stall until song #3 in a tanda, or how I react after a
tanda.  So for them, it's not a question of getting a dance
but getting good reaction versus a polite "Thank You".

Hi,

I do not want to be disrespectful but the reality is that a couple of 
Colombians were top awarded 1st place in stage Tango last year. The Colombian 
couple won dancing with Canyengue flair, and a in kind of performance which 
harkens back to about 1890 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

 Hi Sean,

 There you go again with your new-fangled teaching techniques. I think my beginner students understand ... "twist at the
 waist". I don't think they'd understand ... "disassociate the hips and ribs and to sense the positions of their ribs and hips. And
 your students have to develop that sense before you actually teach them the Ocho? Wow, with that kind of dedication, I'm not
 surprised your students can walk, do rock steps and Ochos - and all within 6-months.

 Sean, you sound like my advanced-level Ballroom instructor. I certainly hope teaching Tango isn't going in that direction, where
 the dancers are concentrating so much on technique that they lose the joy of dancing.

 Hi Konstantin,

 Great reply. I hope Sean gets the message, but I doubt it. He'll probably be teaching all that stuff in your final paragraph in
 his next beginner class :-).

Keith,

That is probably a little harsh.  Sean is a teacher who cares, and who is
working not just to find creative ways to help his students improve, but to
then communicate a difficult concept with all of us.

I suspect that the main problem is that talking about the technique rapidly
becomes very wordy and stilted-sounding.  It is a problem with communicating
via e-mail rather than in person, not necessarily a problem of his
understanding of either Tango or dance.

A slightly edited quote: "Technique must be mastered only because the body
must not stand in the way of the soul's expression" - La Meri

 Budweiser is ... well, is it even beer? I doubt you're even a beer drinker since you can't

Hey Bruno:
You know I have a lot of respect for people who do stage work at the caliber
you mention. Would love to see at least a video clip of the couple you
mentioned. Regardless if it is my cup of tea or not.

I guess Nina was referring to a style of expression she really likes
regardless if it on stage or not, and is on the caliber of world class.

Nina: I have to agree with you about the Argentine women. When they get into
that "zone", they do something that is really hot. Nope not going to say
what it is either. That is a private dance,,, out on the floor.

Hi,

I do not want to be disrespectful but the reality is that a couple of 
Colombians were top awarded 1st place in stage Tango last year. The
Colombian 
couple won dancing with Canyengue flair, and a in kind of performance which 
harkens back to about 1890 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Great points, Sean!

I have observed that American men, in general (with exceptions, of 
course) seem to prefer to appear casual and "down-to-earth" instead 
of dashing and debonaire.  It shows in tango.  Why do you think this 
is?  Is it the historical heritage of the country?  Is it the pop culture?

This is disappointing...I really like dashing and debonaire dandies, 
in life and in tango.

Argentine culture is so much more formal than the American culture... 
Now I am getting all teary-eyed and sentimental...

[back to reality]

About the world-class dancers - neither America, not any other 
country other than Argentina seems to have managed to produce one 
yet.  If you are not Argentine, you cannot be a world-class tango 
dancer and might as well forget about it because the world of tango, 
with all the "classy" dancing,  begins and ends in Argentina.:)  This 
is an absolute.  But it helps all the other people in the world to be 
free just to dance.

Best,

Nina

Besides being facile as "cultural analysis," the isn't remotely true of 
tango teachers. I've seen purveyors of "quality" who are pure crap, and 
step-centric teachers who get dancers striving for real quality simply 
by moving with it themselves. Don't assume that everyone buys the 
advertising, especially in this country.

Huddling these two under the same umbrella makes "world class" rather a

Tango Society of Central Illinois said previously:

"Each year we get 1 or 2 young men (in their 20s) who become competent
social tango dancers (close embrace) within 6 months. I believe it is
possible for some men to achieve basic skills of partner connection,
connection with the music, and navigation, all while having a good
balanced walk, within 6 months. Their repertoire is mosly walking,
rock steps (some turning), several variations on the ocho cortado and
basic back ochos. Their dance is simple but with good basic tango
skills. On the other hand if instruction focuses on teaching giros,
ganchos, boleos, volcadas, colgadas and the like, you can have dancers
with 2-3 years tango experience who still can't walk with grace and
balance to the music."

    I'd be out of business, if people learnt only this in half a year
(even though wouldn't ever teach colgadas in the first year - counting
the average 3-5 hours per week tango involvement). The tango scene in
Hungary was dominated by stage dancers during its initial expansion,
so people rarely dance simple at the milongas (you can't even try:
some women don't even understand if you lead steps less than half a
meter...). This makes dancers of beginner-level knowledge feel
completely incompetent and drives them towards fancy stuff. A great
number of beginners choose to take lessons with stage dancers because
they are teaching "more than walks and ochos".

    People will never learn Tango unless they keep coming to the

    fair enough. And, if I don't do it, even in a small place like HK
there are 5 or 6 other couples who will. But it's still the visiting
    Show Tango instructors who teach the really wild stuff - and those
classes are always packed!

_____________________________________


OK, so local tango instructors should teach exhibition tango for
social dancing because of economics. I've always suspected this, but
now we have 2 instructors admitting it. There are probably dozens more
who believe the same, and perhaps hundreds more who don't know any
better because they have never been to Buenos Aires and seen social
tango as it is danced in the city of its origin (and they believe that
what the Argentine stage dancers teach them is tango for the social
dance floor). And so worldwide we have this epidemic of
psuedo-dramatic space-eating tango that is typically devoid of
connection to the music and at war with the line of dance, a real
caricature of the tango danced in the milongas of Buenos Aires. And
good Argentine social tango dancers have tears in their eyes when they
see what has been done to their tango.

One could argue that this is OK. After all, in the early part of the
20th century North Americans and Europeans were exposed to tango as it
was danced socially then by Argentines and then quickly adapted it for
local cultural tastes. This over time produced a dance called 'tango'
with a marching walk with the spine arched backwards and 'head
flicks', danced to music with strong drumming. Any culture can call
whatever people dance socially 'tango' as long as it was connected
historically to something called 'tango' in Argentina. Context is
unimportant as local customs shape the cultural eveolution of tango as
it diffuses around the globe. You can even dance this 'tango' to disco
music or gypsy music or Sting. How cool! And you can still call it
"tango"!!

However, then you're missing what Argentine tango has to offer - a
close connection to partner and music, improvised at the movement to
adapt to music and space. There's no other dance like it. But you
don't have to dance it that way. The rest of the world isn't.

I brew and vint for a hobby. Budweiser is only world-class in the same 
sense the MacDonald's is -- it's a well-run corporation & you can find 
it everywhere. Otherwise it is a solidly unremarkable pilsner. Guiness 
on the other hand *is* a world-class brew although far to strong for 
most folks. [FWIW the unique flavor is because they burn their malt 
before brewing.]  The only reason you find it so often is because us 
Irish are everywhere. Fortunately as long as there is alcohol we won't 
be taking over the world anytime soon... ;o>

Historically the emphasis in the US has been on the common folk and 
democracy here is a reflection of that. A strong strain of American 
thinking that goes back to the Revolutionary War is against such dandies 
and nobility. Elitism was frowned upon until recently although now it is 
becoming much more fashionable. For instance, no longer do the liberals 
in this country make even a pretense of liking the working classes, 
which is a huge change from a few decades ago. They tend to lump them 
all together as rednecks and get the vapors while talking about them. 
Much anti-Americanism abroad is also aimed squarely at this facet of our 
thinking and many times the US is portrayed as being run by a bunch of 
cowboys or other illiterate yobs. Factually this is incorrect and it 
maybe argued that the US has generally excellent public and private 
management, or we wouldn't be so successful. That is another chat though.

Now, for a long time I used to believe that women were all for equality. 
I now realize they are dirty rotten liars. ;o> [Lemma 'splain before you 
get your knickers in a knot that I do support equality of women in the 
workplace and society. I'm discussing interpersonal relations here. I'm 
putting this comment here so *when* I get quoted out of context I can 
tell you that you are idiots who can't read. Be warned.] What I mean is 
that equality brings with it anonymity -- if we are truly equal then 
there is really no distinction between us, is there? "Discrimination" in 
this context is being able to tell people apart from one another. Women 
(and men!) do not want this in their personal relationships. Women want 
to be treated as the unique people they are. Men want a women that makes 
the world stop for them. So, in tango I agree that the normal  American 
egalitarian ideas tend to go against the grain. Part of the flavor is 
treating the ladies well, not like a truck driver, and having them 
reciprocate.

Trini, here.  Actually, in moving efficiently, it's muscles
deeper than the obliques that produce rotation.  Here's a
quote from my Dance Kinesiology book, which is used as a
textbook in many university dance programs.

"For example, turning the shoulders to face the left is a
joint action involving a maintenance of extension and
active rotation to the left.  (Remember that gravity is a
flexor of the spine in an upright position.)  This would
require a static contraction of the extensor muscles
(extension fibers of erector spinae, deep posterior muscles
and semispinalis) and shortening contraction of the left
rotators (left rotation fibers of the erector spinae and
the deep posterior muscles, and the right side of the
semispinalis.)"

Nowhere does she mention obliques.  The erector spinae is a
group of vertical muscles that attach to various points of
the ribcage and spine.  Deep posterior muscles go from
vertebrae to vertebrae.

When we teach, we don't get into that level of detail,
except for our most dedicated students.  We simply let
students think about their spine and loosening it up enough
to enable more movement.  Beginning lessons with a massage
helps them understand this.  

Keith has obviously not reached a level of dancing that
teachers are willing to discuss these details with him. 
When instructors from Argentina visit, we discuss things
like this all the time.  And they get excited and pleased
that some people care to really learn the details.  Which
is why they like coming back here to teach.  So they often

students during workshops or privates.

Some of these instructors know so much, it's a shame when

Hey all,
I'm one of Sean's (Trina's) students/past student.  Cut the guy some slack, 
will ya!  Years ago, he gave me the dances of my life at my first milonga 
and I'd barely danced tango.  He led well and was considerate of my beginner 
abilities and made it so fun all I could think about was getting more tango, 
and more and more...

Guinness fan,
Jen

That was almost my point. I would call it an undefined
term, rather than meaningless. As Jeff pointed out,
"Budweiser is only world-class in the same sense the
MacDonald's is - it's a well-run corporation & you can find
it everywhere." 

We have no way of knowing what Keith means when he talks
about producing world class dancers, but I think we can
safely assume that he's not using the phrase to mean the
same thing that Nina uses it to mean. When people toss
undefined terms around, we are only able to interpret them
based on what we know about them from prior posts.  As Ron
has observed, Keith's pedagogy is formed around his
perception of economic necessity. Given his focus on
perceived market forces, I believe his use of the term
"world class" is similar to my Budweiser example. That's
why I huddled the disparate meanings under the same
umbrella and suggested that the phrase not be taken
seriously.

Hi Chris,

Perhaps you'd be interested in a system based on radians rather than 
degrees... Just think of the wonderful symmetry that would result from 
"lapices" drawn exactly the length of the radius created by the leg of the 
leader as he draws his lapiz. Now imagine the women doing their ochos in 
multiples of radians... It would be much simpler and mathematically precise. 
Hey, maybe some teacher could develop the system complete with drawings, 
illustrations and a handy internet course of study including highly 
compressed video files. Perhaps he or she could also include some cardboard 
templates with the appropriate circles, arcs and lines drawn in. This way 
the student could practice with great accuracy, even while sitting in from 
of the computer. ;-)

Didactically,

Manuel

Hi Keith,

Trini, here.  If you were more open to new ideas, then
perhaps instead of fearing losing your students to other
teachers, you'd be in a position more like ours. The other
local teachers (and many regional teachers) send their
students to us.

Happy tangos,
Trini

Dear Trini,

I find the quote you provide very surprising.I think its context might
be different in that it focuses exclusively on the spine movement and
ignoring anything else (see below).

Separately, I find the explanation a bit confusing or misleading.
Here's what I mean:

> "For example, turning the shoulders to face the left is a
> joint action involving a maintenance of extension and
> active rotation to the left. (Remember that gravity is a
> flexor of the spine in an upright position.)

The only way this logcally flows together is if the view taken is that
of the spine exclusively, and the author thinks of it as a compressed
(by gravity) column which needs to extend first to be able to rotate.
So far so good.

> This would require a static contraction of the extensor muscles
> (extension fibers of erector spinae, deep posterior muscles
> and semispinalis)

So far this is naming the muscles the author thinks are involved in
the extension of the spine before its rotation.

BTW, I find usage of phrases like "extension fibers" and (below)
"rotation fibers" misleading. Muscle fibers only contract; it is the
3-D position of the origin and insertion points that determines what
we might call the resulting motion (twisting, bending, extending,
rotating, etc.)

> and shortening contraction of the left
> rotators (left rotation fibers of the erector spinae and
> the deep posterior muscles, and the right side of the
> semispinalis.)"

No idea what rotation fibers are, but we here agree on the small
involvement of the erector spinae (not in rotation, though).

Semispinalis (dorsi, cervicis, capitis) muscles cannot be main movers
in the twisting motion of upper versus lower torso, as they are all in
the thoracic region and up. I can see how they are involved in making
sure the vertebrae acommodate the twisting, though.

Deep posterior muscles -  maybe the author is talking about the
rotatores (but again these are small muscles in the thoracic region
that focus on lifting and/or rotating adjacent vertebrae locally so
cannot be prime movers) or multifidus, which is also not a very large
muscle, acts more locally and probably has a secondary role compared
to the obliques.

What is missing is any discussion of the abdominal muscles,
specifically the external and internal obliques (Obliquus externus
abdominis and Obliquus internus abdominis). I believe this is because
the author focuses only on the vertebral column.

None of this is some new or controversial theory, as far as I know.
You can find it in Gray's anatomy or in any discussion on the action
and function of the obliques.

You are right that it is hard to get to that level of discussion with
students, but I think everyone knows what you mean if you mention the
obliques and avoid too much detail.

With best regards,

Konstantin

I am not sure what is it with the two of you (some deep personal
history I do not care to know the details of), but these personal
insults you hurl at each other are obviously distracting from the
discussion.

Even if what I say turns out to be more accurate, I don't see how this
implies anything terrible about whoever held a less accurate position.
Aren't we all students in life, for life, and always happy to add more
knowledge or refine or correct whatever we have accumulated so far?

I've seen a handful of guys get well on their way _toward_ this point in 
6 months (@ 3+ long nights per week). Usually dudes who end up dating 
someone in the community (of whatever level) figure things out more 
quickly-- not always, but often enough for it to have emerged as a 
subtle pattern. One I can observe, anyway.

With women, I notice similar progress among those who befriend other 
_growing_ dancers (again, of whatever level... and whether the friends 
are fellow chicks or guys who are making active progress.)

At bottom, I'd say that learning is contagious-- which is why group 
classes can indeed be very productive, and why privates sometimes 
flounder if the student is too isolated in their growth. Group classes 
of course have their liabilities as well, if you approach them 
stupidly-- but so does a loaf of bread, in that case.
> I don't agree with teaching raw beginners to do ganchos, barridas,

This past April, I taught a workshop on sacadas for men & women, in your 
community, with a mix of students including a "raw beginner" or three. 
To me it's just walking... and I strove to convey that understanding of 
the dance (e.g., by repeating it ad nauseam, starting with the walk, 
showing variations based on the walk). If there have been any adverse 
effects, I trust you'll let me know.

To me, the elegance & simplicity of the tango is a matter of 
distillation. I don't teach moves because I want to see my students 
doing such moves predominantly. I want to see them doing moves well, and 
without bogus ideas, whenever and if ever they choose to do them.

Nor will I tell them they don't have to walk through any fires in their 
learning & growth. I could only do that by selling them false shortcuts, 
being a kiss-ass, and in short, purveying bullshit.

Well, it's simple, and yet not easy, only because you can't practice for 
your students. Most dancers just need to dance more, and forget about 
the packaging of growth, in order to grow. Then classes and lessons 
start to have far more value: they have to be supplements, not the center.

My favorite comic book artist once made the familiar observation that 
you have to throw away your first 1,000 pages before you can find 
yourself and start doing it for real. Some dancers, in tango terms, 
cover that process of initial discovery in 6 months or a year, and then 
begin to mature just fine; some take 5 years, and feel so choked by then 
that they lose all heart.

When a student comes to me and I don't see them at enough milongas, I 
pester them about it. I suggest partners and encourage them to hit a 
group class to meet people & see someone else's teaching. Or whatever. 
My very first night of tango, I danced for 3 hours after 60 minutes of 
instruction from another guy. The ratio I ask of my students is about 
twice that-- 2 or 3 nights per week, for every weekly lesson. Many 
exceed that standard (with or without my badgering), and have a great 
time because of it.

We also discuss the music a lot, and sometimes the food in different 
venues. Occasionally we laugh at how bad Argentine painting is, as 
opposed to the graphic design (e.g., sheet music covers), but that's off 
the clock.
> People can take lessons for years from good teachers, and still 
> struggle to dance simply, elegantly and with the music.
I'd surmise this is the case when you've got a person who doesn't 
already know simplicity or elegance in life, or who doesn't enjoy 
listening to Any music. (I.e., as a sole activity, not as background 
while something else is occupying their attention. That's not 
listening.) For that, one needs not a tango teacher but probably a 
friend or jazz bar, or some good poetry from several centuries ago, or 
cognac.

But under normal circumstances, I'd say the struggle with 
teaching/learning only arises when someone isn't getting out for enough 
social dancing. You can't expect any kind of supervised training to take 
the place of practice & experience. Plenty of folks do that 
unthinkingly, sure; but double their number and they're all still wrong. 
If you imposed a quota of social dancing on your students, so that they 
had to hit 2 milongas (or whatever) between lessons, I think you'd see 
that it ain't so hard after all, for either of you.

Most people who don't already know this just need it pointed out. It's 
too easy to forget these things, and end up preoccupied with some 
charlatanism out of a dance PhD program, or yoga, or some other 
distraction which has less to do with tango than a Hollywood rose in 
American teeth.

Damn near every good dancer I know has been a tango dropout at some 
point. We never much talk about that... and yet, sometimes I think the 
only thing anyone really needs is to quit. The ones who succeed at that 
move on with their lives, and the rest of us are just miserable failures 
who couldn't stay quit-- puppets who lace on special shoes and shuffle 
around at the behest of Troilo's fingers every night-- rank lowlifes who 
talk about the little muscles that stitch our spines together.

So eager to score marks you miss the point.  

Control your body, or it controls you.

Control your mouth, or it runs off without you.

Hi Christopher,

Trini, here.  That's a nice exercise.  It might be easier
if one could visualize it like a clock instead of degrees. 
So if 12:00 was always the direction your chest was facing,
you'd be at 1:30, 3:00, 3:00, 4:30, 7:30, 7:30, 9:00, 4:30,
correct?

Repeat for backward ochos.  You're right about controlling
foot placement.

Message-ID: <B83F87BD-4A6E-4C61-AE0B-BBF6CF891F01@tangobliss.com>

All,

I wonder if its that difficult for this group to actually have a  
discussion that isn't acrimonious ?

In my 15 years online in every forum I've either managed or been  
party to there has always been a level of common human decency in  
email communications.  And at the very least, the flame wars were  
eventually taken offline and conversation resumed in a civilized and  
humane manner.  This list is the exception to that rule.  This list  
not only needs to be moderated or at the very least some level of  
control and inhibition needs to be put in place, it further needs to  
get a grip on how to treat one another.

I have been party to and co-created that level acrimoniousness in the  
last 6 months (giving as good as I've gotten, and I despised and  
chided myself for doing just that!), but this stuff is just  
heartbreaking and a pain to have to deal with on a regular basis.  I  
can easily see why so many people leave.  I know of a half dozen  
alone this week from the bay area.  You'd think we were all  
squabbling children with the way that we speak to each other online.

I can imagine this same conversations in an actual room, and I can  
virtually guarantee that a.) they it'd never happen, and b.) there'd  
be a level of civil discourse that resembled a tea party of the 18th  
century, where politeness and civility were the norm, and nary a  
harsh word was spoken or even whispered.

Is that possible ?

M i l e s.

Well Nina, you might want to rethink what you have written.  Junior 
Cervila,  he is in my opinion an excellent dancer and 
from..........Brasil.  The same for Paulo Araujo.  In NYC there is Angel 
Clemente Garcia, one of the best ..... and a Mexican.  There are people 
from other places as well that are wonderful dancers.

I have been dragged and pushed around the floor like a dust mop by 
several Argentine name brands who without a choreographed dance could 
not lead their way out of a dark cave with 1000 lit torches.  There are 
many Argentines who cannot dance gracefully or elegantly.  Sometimes I 
watch them and I cannot for the life of me figure out what people think 
is so great about them other than they speak English, charge lots of 
money, and are arrogant, therefore, they must be good.

Now another myth....there are not a million wonder dancers here.  It is 
all relative.  When I came here in 2000 I thought each and everyone of 
them was wonderful, incredible.  I marveled at what I thought was 
dancing to the music.  Now I live and dance here and I can tell you, 
that here is no better here than there.  (Wherever there is) There are 
maybe less than 10 men I want to dance with.  Here is the 
difference...we have more dancers, more places to dance.  So it might 
seem like there are lots more good dancers.  It is all relative.  If you 
live in Iowa then San Francisco seems like Mecca.  I lived in San 
Francisco and as I commuted to Buenos Aires, San Francisco did not seem 
much like Mecca to me.  The percentages of good dancers "should" be 
higher when there are more dancers....because there are more dancers.

Dancing with bad dancers.  I don't do it.  Not knowingly.  The best 
dancers here male and female sit until they want to dance.  When the 
music is right, when there is someone to dance with.  Once this 
gentleman I know came into the milonga. He came to get me to dance to a 
tanda.  He told me that I was going to be his only tanda of the evening 
and then he was going to leave.  His reason was the women left him 
uninspired.  Maybe this sounds harsh, but this is not unusual here.  One 
night we went to 3 milongas because we as women were uninspired.  We 
were trying to find out where the men were to dance with.  We ended up 
drinking champagne in Gricel.

What happens when I accept a dance with a man who is not that good.    I 
dance with him if he is a nice guy.  It is not his fault we both made a 
mistake.  If he is completely undanceable, at least for me.  I have no 
choice but to end the dance.  To walk off the floor here is an insult to 
one of the parties.  Usually it is a verguenza for the man, not me.  
Here you need to earn the right to walk off the floor.  I can do it, but 
I do not like to.  Not unless the man is a total jerk, or he is hurting 
me with his horrible dancing.  How do I dance with them?  I concentrate 
very hard on my balance and axis to stay upright, and many times I have 
to look at the floor because there is no lead.  Even more so I do not 
dance close embrace if the dancer is really poor.  Then I would really 
be dragged around.  If the man is from the U.S. and used to dancing 
patterns, I have to watch his feet.  I no longer live in the U.S. and 
therefore do not know what patterns are now being taught, so I have to 
figure out the steps before they happen.

The point is that tango is tango.

  dear Chris UK, I think people don?t understand you when you say
.no technique, classes are bad
no group
.lessons
... May be you should I walk the talk and *show us* what is possible.. by *just dancing*.
   
  All we know is you:
  Learnt tango by 'just dancing' [without going to classes, without learning 'technique's etc..]
  Have had very bad experience with teachers
  Sincerely think that followers don?t have to go to classes, they learn by dancing with 'good' dancers [like yourself?..perhaps]
   
  Just to get an idea of what you are talking about, will you be kind enough to post a video of yourself dancing, so the viewers can decide whether :
  1) Continue to learn the way they do because they aren't impressed by your 'dancing'
  OR ..2) Stop going classes because they like your dancing and want follow your example
   
  Ofcourse you may pick a partner who has never been tango classes, technique classes etc. so you can demonstrate your now legendary leading skills.
   
  
.show them the way by dancing[ instead of talking about dancing
apologies for borrowing your lines:)].

Deby,

I just want to clarify that we are not talking about the same 
things.  You are talking about Brazil, Mexico, San Francisco, i.e. 
places that belong to the world.

I am talking about the world of Argentine tango.  The world of 
Argentine tango begins and ends in Argentina.  If it exits, it 
becomes some other world, like the geographic world.  The geographic 
world-class is too low of a standard of dancing.  The Argentine 
world-class is the real thing.

So, in terms of the world-class dancer, with the world beginning and 
ending in Argentina, no other geographic place can produce one.

So one can go to Argentina, into the world of tango that is, and try 
to become a world-class dancer there even if they were not born 
Argentine.  And it still will not happen because of that tiny blemish 
of the wrong origin.

The bottom line is that in order to be considered a true world-class 
dancer, one must be hailed to be so by the Argentines 
themselves.  And if you are not Argneitne, that will never 
happen.  Argentines are fanatical nationalists.

Warmest regards,

Nina

Ummmm, let me see how I can reply to this.... ... B.... S.... 
I can't remember where I have seen more arrogance than on this list.
And people say people from the US are arrogant. We have a long way to go to

But... our American arrogance is very meek - what arrogance it is to

Message-ID: <944912.34547.qm@web62509.mail.re1.yahoo.com>


Of all postings to this list this posting by Nina is
the most nonsensical
and offensive.  

Nina is not only arrogant but also misinformed about
the history of the
dance.  Little does she know about the history of the
dance.  That the
Argentines on the turn of the last century condemned
Tango (and disowning
it)and the French welcomed with open arms.   That the
Tango is not an
Argentine product, but the product of fusion between
afro-Caribbean and
European rhythms.   That in an era of increasing
global awareness any claims
to sole cultural ownership over any practice is silly
and infantile.

Nina statement is a disservice to all of the great
masters.  It is a
disservice to all of the hard working folks attempting
to promote tango as
an universal art form.

Cheers,
Amaury

I can't remember where I have seen more arrogance than

And people say people from the US are arrogant. We

Oops, sorry, was that arrogant?

Deby,

I just want to clarify that we are not talking about
the same 
things.  You are talking about Brazil, Mexico, San
Francisco, i.e. 
places that belong to the world.

I am talking about the world of Argentine tango.  The
world of 
Argentine tango begins and ends in Argentina.  If it
exits, it 
becomes some other world, like the geographic world. 
The geographic 
world-class is too low of a standard of dancing.  The
Argentine 
world-class is the real thing.

So, in terms of the world-class dancer, with the world
beginning and 
ending in Argentina, no other geographic place can
produce one.

So one can go to Argentina, into the world of tango
that is, and try 
to become a world-class dancer there even if they were
not born 
Argentine.  And it still will not happen because of
that tiny blemish 
of the wrong origin.

The bottom line is that in order to be considered a
true world-class 
dancer, one must be hailed to be so by the Argentines 
themselves.  And if you are not Argneitne, that will
never 
happen.  Argentines are fanatical nationalists.

Warmest regards,

Nina

My former teacher gave me an exercise that was designed to help me with lapices. I stand on my left foot, hook the other foot around it, rotate my shoulders to my left, followed by my hips, then by my support foot. The idea is to keep turning in a circle, each turn being about 1/4 of a circle. The turn is to be done slowly to force me to hold my axis. After turning on my left foot, I stand on my right foot, hook the left behind it, and turn to the right.

I leave tomorrow for the NY tango festival (www.celebratetango.com). Looking forward to the milonga Thursday on the Staten Island Ferry, leaving Manhattan at 4 and Staten Island at 4:30 (same boat). The sour news is my favorite NY restaurant, Lundys in Brooklyn's Sheepshead Bay, closed earlier this year. I just loved those biscuits.

Miles,  don't read this!  It is totally uncivilized!


I am on my knees begging forgiveness of all the well-educated, 
well-informed, super sensitive, delicate beings on this list who do 
not bother to contribute to the world of tango knowledge except when 
mortally offended.

And I take full credit for making people like Amaury so outraged that 
their little voices are finally heard roaring defending the history, 
the great maestros, and the glorious history of tango and its 
rhythms!  And they manage to offend most Argentines by claiming that 
tango is not an Argentine product!  Such gorgeous idealism and 
ignorance makes me misty...

Hey folks, in case those of you who have been dancing for a decade or 
two do not know, Argentine Tango is European!

You go, Amaury!  I am cheering you on!

Nina
Arrogant, abnoxious and bored-to-tears

P.S. Universal art form?!  I swear that these greedy foreigners just 
want to make my Argentine Tango their own!

But Nina dear:
It is what people have done since time immortal. Some for benevolent reasons
and some out of pure ego. It does not really matter these reasons.

What matters is that I dance, and that I do not forget where tango came
from. It also matters what I am adding to tango for the ones who dance and
will be dancing. It matters even more that I do not forget my own past.

As for the comment about your knees, (no begging that part just does not
work with you). Nice!

>From one idiot on the dance floor to another (yes, you miles and the other
fools here as well). As many argentines have said: Shut the hell up, dance,
show me what you got, you think too much.

Zorrito...
Am off to dance.

I am on my knees begging forgiveness of all the well-educated, 
well-informed, super sensitive, delicate beings on this list who do 
not bother to contribute to the world of tango knowledge except when 
mortally offended.

And I take full credit for making people like Amaury so outraged that 
their little voices are finally heard roaring defending the history, 
the great maestros, and the glorious history of tango and its 
rhythms!  And they manage to offend most Argentines by claiming that 
tango is not an Argentine product!  Such gorgeous idealism and 
ignorance makes me misty...

Hey folks, in case those of you who have been dancing for a decade or 
two do not know, Argentine Tango is European!

You go, Amaury!  I am cheering you on!

Arrogant, abnoxious and bored-to-tears

P.S. Universal art form?!  I swear that these greedy foreigners just

Subject: [Tango-L] Argentine Tango
Message-ID: <BAY105-F2031C9285A6AE7E427F99997FA0@phx.gbl>

Somebody says:

"Tango is not an
Argentine product, but the product of fusion between
afro-Caribbean and
European rhythms.   That in an era of increasing
global awareness any claims
to sole cultural ownership over any practice is silly
and infantile."

Even if that was true, the 'product of fusion" is an Argentine/Uruguayan 
creation.

More specifically the creation of certain people, in the periphery of the 
cities of Buenos aires and Montevideo.

Afro-Caribbean and European rhythms collided in other areas of the world and 
created "other products of fusion" :

Jazz in USA, Samba in Brazil, Rumba, Cha-cha, mambo, bolero in Cuba, Cumbia 
in Colombia, Salsa in Puerto Rico, Merengue in The Dominican Republic.

So most of the ballroom dances originated in a similar way, in America, due 
to the interaction of African and European rhythms.

Argentine tango and Jazz have in common the fact that they originated in 
poor areas of metropolitan cities, the other dances have a rural root 
instead.

In this respect the urban forces at play in the genesis of tango are more 
similar to Rebetica (in Greece) and Fado (in Portugal).

In Summary we should not think that the ingredients (flower, apples, sugar, 
cinnamon) individually are the same as an Apple Pie.

Argentine Tango is a reflection of the "porten`o" character, spirit, soul, 
idiosyncrasy the same as rebetica, fado, Jazz are cultural reflections of 
the people that originated them.

As any artistic creation it belongs to the whole humanity. Argentines are 
very proud, and happy that Tango is embraced and danced all over the world.

This has nothing to do with being a good or a poor dancer. Many Porteos do 
not know how to dance tango.   Many foreigners dance better than most 
porteos . But... world class dancers are either Argentines or foreigners 
trained by Argentines ...so far .

If I am wrong I would humbly like to know who is a world class tango dancer 
who was trained by foreign instructors. I am certain that this is happening 
some place right now but I do not know where. Thank you for your help.


Best regards, Sergio

Hi,

It seems to me that the statements below need some significant qualifiers.

That is not true on its face. A more accurate statement would be that
the _wealthy_ or high society Argentines (i.e. the ones that could
shape the discussion, the ones with the voice to be heard the loudest
and recorded) condemned tango (before the French accepted it). This is
not an insignificant detail. The working class Argentines created
tango and obviously embraced and liked tango from its beginning. I
don't think they were less Argentines than the upper class were.


> That theTango is not an

Rhythm is only one of several parts of a musical form though. Even so,
pre-1920 tangos borrowed the Cuban habanera rhythm pattern of
dotted-eight, sixteenth, eight, eight. However this pattern was
imported from the slaves in Haiti, and they were brought to Haiti from
West Africa. I do not know what European rhythms are referred to here
when we talk about tango (and not vals, for example), but in any case
the evidence shows that any syncopated rhythm pattern (one example is
the habanera pattern above) that was imported in "civilized" Europe
ultimately came from West African and other black people's drum lines.

In fact the theory is that the habanera pattern came as a 3-2 rhythm
pattern (alternating or mixing 3-long and 2-long rhythm blocks is
something common in African drum lines) which was something
incomprehensible, with its implied 5/8 time signature, to western
Europe. So the sailors and others distorted the 3-long block and
shortened it to fit into a 2-long block, thus "straightening" the time
signature into a 2/4 or 4/8 and the pattern into the habanera pattern
mentioned above. The other consequence was that whenever songs had
accents or notes on all three eights of the original 3-long block,
this became a triplet (to fit into 2 eights). Habaneras are filled
with these triplets, as were very early tangos. See even Bizet's
Carmen - the famous habanera (which was really Sebastien Yradier's El
Arreglito habanera that Bizet borrowed thinking it was a folk tune.)

I don't think all this rhythm genealogy business makes tango less
Argentine or somehow a derivative from Europe. The habanera rhythm
pattern is not tango.

Rhythm aside, it was Argentines who took, at first, whatever portable
instruments they had, later the bandoneon and piano and violins of
different sizes, and created the musical form, and it was Argentines,
mostly immigrants from Italy and Spain, and others, who created the
dance form in conventillos.

With best regards,

That's odd. Every on-line forum I've seen in ends up like this. 
The "know it all's" always start to duke it out.   

And moderators? Please. That's the best way to really kill a group.

Heartbreaking? Despising & chiding yourself? Miles, get a grip!
It's more funny than anything else. 
How can anyone read some of this stuff and not laugh out loud?

No Miles, this list does not need to be moderated. It was moderated at one 
time and it was the worst situation imaginable. We had a petty tyrant and 
chief censor who ran roughshod over anyone he decided to target. Also, this 
forum is far more funny and hilarious than mean and offensive, Where else 
can I get the recommended daily minimum allowance of driverl and foolishnes? 
At the very least some of these threads exist so we can all remember that 
utter silliness and foolishness are everywhere and reminds us  to laugh.

If you are so distressed by the antics of our fellow listeros and listeras, 
you might want to just take a break for a while and just go dancing. It will 
do you a world of good ;-)

Cheers,

Manuel

 Miles,

 You must have led a very sheltered life if you think the antics on this forum are acrimonious. Try telling a 6ft Irish foreman
 that he doesn't have enough cement in his concrete and you'll learn the meaning of acrimonious :-). And lets use the real word,
 shall we  - moderator is just a fancy name for censor. And that would be the worst possible thing for this list. Just take it easy 
 - it's only words.

 And, all the recent talk about beer reminded me of something I heard years ago, but can't remember where. It was along the
 lines of ... "Dancing Tango is like a feeling of wearing a tuxedo and drinking fine wine, whereas dancing Milonga is more a 
 feeling of wearing jeans and drinking beer with your buddies". Anybody know where that came from?

 Hi Trini,

 You and Sean are obviously a match made in heaven. I'm glad you found each other.

 But, tell me, do you and Sean dance and teach dancing for a living or is it just a hobby? And what about the other local 
 teachers? I can't  imagine they're professionals or why would they be turning business away and sending their students
 elsewhere? It's a whole different ball game when you rely on students to put bread on the table and I'm not going to apologise
 for trying to make a  living. And, fortunately, there are still a lot of people out there who prefer qualified professionals to 
 enthusiastic amateurs.
 
 Best Regards,
 Keith, HK

Subject: [Tango-L] On the influence of european rhythms in Tango
Message-ID: <1184738942.469dae7e4e292@webmail.telus.net>

>On European rhythms which influenced Tango:

By Pompeyo Camps , "Tango and Ragtime: a parallel in time and distance" 
Cultural Service of the United States of America, Buenos Aires
1976
publication, "The African influence in Tango has been primorial" Newspaper "La 
Opinion", Buenos Aires, March 12, 1977.

....The band - that historical institution of the United States with its 
marching pieces and polkas of european origin. They furnished black  pianists 
the emulsifying agent of the music of a dual race. It was the 2/4 measure "in 
tempo de marcia", the way music was notated by Joplin ( or Slow march tempo) 
with the classic accompaniment of the double bass in 1/4 notes and music chords 
in contratempo of 1/8 notes. This corresponds to the pianist's playing with his 
left hand,  while with the right hand plays the cut sincopations and the 
displaced accents, which are  characteristic of the African rhythms.


On the working class who created tango:
If you mean the first forms of Tango you might be referring to soldiers and 
women of black descent who appeared to be a subclass within a working class.

Regards,

Bruno

As for the evolution of tango and its origins (apropos the remarks of 
Konstantine, Sergio, et al)...

I've read various arguments, each of which centers on a different 
"pivotal" moment, emphasizing different details to arrive at the desired 
historical climax.

Some claim that the dance came first (when treating its urban history), 
and that the music developed afterward, to support & encourage the dance.

Others claim that the early city-dance was an import of the gauchos who 
moved into (or were at any rate nearby) the city outskirts, and who 
influenced the compadritos. And also that the gauchos had campfire 
dances, which skewed the (not from the Pampas) habanera into the 
earliest milongas.

Others claim that the compadritos were mocking traditional (?) dances of 
the blacks.

Others claim that the blacks were the original tango dancers.

Then there's the whole brothel thing, which Borges said not many 
aficionados even believed.

So how it started, and who gets the credit, is anyone's guess. The only 
verifiable fact seems to be that some schmucks took it to Europe, and 
that by the time it came back to Argentina, there were lower-class 
people dancing it "old-school," and bourgeois types learning it 
new-school Euro style.

THEREFORE...

Since the original export eventually became a different dance (aka 
Ballroom)...
And since the re-import clashed with the pre-import, which hardly had a 
national character...

... the only viable conclusion, however you slice it, is that the first 
_inauthentic_ tango dancers were Argentine.

According to each other, anyway.

I hear the first exporters were idolized in Europe as the genuine 
article though.

Jake,

I agree wholeheartedly with you. 

As the conversation evolves one important point should
not be missed.  That
the initial comment posted by one of our 'listeras' if
taken seriously will
not add anything constructive to the world of
Argentine Tango.  On the
contrary it alienates and obscures the efforts of
dancers and instructors
around the world.

I do have a question to our group.  Lets for a minute,
for the sake of
conversation, accept the argument supporting national
origin as a factor
influencing artistic performance.  Would the same
apply to music playing and
composing?  

If so, than Yo-Yo Ma is a hell of an Argentine.
 
Cheers,
Amaury

A few years ago - at the time the first Campeonato Mundial was cancelled -, I posted a letter here on this list, in which I said, that the economical crisis of Argentina created an even greater urge to make tango exclusive Argentine property, and ultimately create a situation where nothing will be called "real" Argentine Tango that is not danced by an Argentine.

I was attacked for that remark.

I never doubted that the tango is strongly linked to Argentina. 

My problem was that tango would NOT be viable as a popular dance in (or at least the masters would not be limited to) Argentina anymore without the foreign tourists financing it (both tango and the economy built around tango). 

This is also the reason why in other countries, there is much less chance of having brilliant tango masters evolving. For example: if in Hungary we had a hundred tango dancers who'd like to (and could) _make a living_ (become professionals) on really rich foreigners visiting the country for tango, a potential master would have both the financing, the possibility and the motivation to become that master. 

This is the economy of tango. It does confirm that tango masters are more likely to be Argentine or at least living in Argentina (Buenos Aires to be exact), while it does take the credit away from "birthright", "sucked in with the mothermilk" theories.

Also, it implies, that contemporary and especially future tango is NOT (going to be) an exclusively Argentine product. Or at least not more than Armani is an Italian product (check how many Italians wear Armani in Italy)... or (in the near future) as Nike is a Chinese product (their manufacturing is mostly located in China). 

Simply because it is one of the basic principles in business is to sell consumers what they want. The consumers are not Argentine, so that makes tango take a form (as it is already doing both by being over-authentic, showy or "new") the consumers want it.

IL,

Maybe you missed Chris' post last year. Chris has actualy attended classes with more than 60 [yes, 60] different teachers. But he's never explained why he eventually decided they were worse-than-useless or why it took him so long to come to that conclusion. 

Since his dislike of teachers has no logic, I tend to think it's envy - after all, teachers are actually getting paid for what Chris would obviously be happy to do for free.

Subject: [Tango-L] Argentine Tango II
Message-ID: <BAY105-F14194073813F0A66A610E797FA0@phx.gbl>

Amaury asks ; (thank you Amaury for stimulating an interesting discussion):

"I do have a question to our group.  Lets for a minute,
for the sake of
conversation, accept the argument supporting national
origin as a factor
influencing artistic performance.  Would the same
apply to music playing and
composing?

If so, than Yo-Yo Ma is a hell of an Argentine.

Cheers,
Amaury "

It is precisely in the music where the Argentine character is expressed the 
most.

It is obvious that one of the most important ancestors of tango is the 
Milonga. The early tangos were very similar to the milonga. Even today some 
of those primitive tangos such as "el Porteito",
"El Esquinazo" or "El Entreriano" are frequently thought to be milongas 
abroad.

La milonga was born in rural areas where the main entertainment of the 
gauchos was to gather around a fire and play the guitar.

They had verbal competitions in which one of them would improvise lyrics, 
usually in the form of a question, on a certain theme ( philosophical 
subjects such as love, life, death, God, fate, etc) as he accompanied 
himself with the guitar. Another cowboy would answer in verse as well.

This is still done in rural areas, mostly as part of the celebration of 
national holidays, along with rodeos.

Blacks listening to this form of "rap" baptized this event with one word of 
their African Language
"Milonga" meaning "palabrerio" too many words.  This original meaning od 
milonga is still used in slang, when somebody comes with a long  complain he 
is told "ok, do not came now with that milonga".

In time this guitar playing at the "Payadas" (this is the name of the verbal 
verse competition), was followed by dancing to the guitar rhythm, (this 
dancing, was also called milonga) and later on the place where the payada 
and the dance took place was also called 'Milonga".

This is the reason we still  go to the "Milonga" today.

Gauchos (cowboys) would bring cattle to the city of Buenos Aires and 
Montevideo and camp in the outskirts where the slaughter houses where 
placed.  It was in this periphery of the city where  the rural milonga 
interacted with other rhythms brought by immigrants from Spain (Tanguillo, 
something like Flamenco) or by sailors from the Caribbean (Habanera) and 
music and dances played at the Candombes of African origin.

>From the confluence of those rhythms it is thought that Argentine Tango was 
born.

Other dances evolved in rural areas,  dances that form part of the rich 
Argentine Folkloric repertoire.

Some of those dances are becoming very popular abroad such as the "Chacarera 
and even the Zamba".

This is getting to be too long so I will stop here for now.

Summary: The dance and the music both are strong reflection of the Argentine 
Character.

Nobody says that you have to dance like an Argentine; although many of you 
do it and learn to do it to perfection, others inject some of their own 
culture and personality in their dancing, this is not wrong.  You should be 
able to dance the way you wish, the way you prefer to do it.

Tango has a strong, broad embrace that encompasses all of us.

Have a nice day, Sergio

Dear male experts,

I'm  happy to read your valuable comments on women's technique that you so generously share with us. 
What would women do without male experts sharing their advanced level of technical knowledge? 
We would be left without technical instructions, 
without 135, 225, 270, 270 and 135 degrees.
We would never know the hidden benefits of the wall. 
We would humbly sit for years without moving. 
Or, what might be even worse, we would have to start quilting if we would live in US or in the UK.
We would be desperate. 
We would have no other choice than to relie on our intuition,  
trust the embrace and our sensitivity to feel the music , 
use our natural skill of movement and humbly 
enjoy 
to go
dancing ;)

Subject: [Tango-L] 6 months
Message-ID: <20070718162759.417D722D30@p3fed1.frb.org>

I generally accept Tete's perspective that dancing tango is about the 
music not the steps.  Tete's perspective does suggest that it is quite 
possible to learn to dance tango reasonably well in six months.  In fact, 
when Susan and I were teaching on a regular basis about half our beginning 
students in group classes were ready to dance passably at a milonga in 
abut 6-8 weeks of once a week lessons for an hour's duration.

Why don't many students learn to dance in six months?  For many years, 
most of the instruction in Argentine tango has been about mastering step 
patterns.  I don't think the problem is in teaching step patterns per se. 
I think it is in concentrating on teaching step patterns to the exclusion 
of teaching to skills that must come first--such as moving to the music 
and a general understanding of how tango is danced.

Teaching beginning tango as walking and as small elements of movement 
creates the possibility of emphasizing the rhythm of the music.  The 
beginning students can assemble these small movements to dance.

After the students have mastered some basic rhythmic and movement skills, 
learning something about the underlying structure of the tango would be 
helpful.  Along the way, some refinement of movement is good.  After that 
the dancer is well prepared to take lessons from some of the many 
instructors who teach tango as step patterns.  With good quality movement, 
a knowledge of the rhythm and the underlying structure of tango, the 
dancer can actually learn something useful from those who are teaching 
step patterns.  Without that knowledge, all that step patterns become mini 
choreographies.

With best regards,
Steve

Sergio,

Thank you for the clear and objective explanation.  If
I understand well we
can definitely say that Argentine was the birth place
of an art form that
combined features from multiple socio, economical and
cultural background. 

So how do we come to terms with the argument that for
one to excel in an art
form one needs to be born in its place of origins? 

I have read similar arguments (albeit in more virulent
forms) throughout
history.  And honestly, the results of such
intellectual stance have
invariably led to ethnic intolerance, dissent,
discrimination and
prosecution.

These were my first words ever posted to the list.  I
am more of a lurker
than a talker.  

However this particular thread stroked a chord in me. 
Perhaps because I
have spent so much of my time volunteering to help
others to take their
first Tango steps.  Or just because I like to think
that as humans we have
in all of us the basic emotions and feelings that are
such fundamental part
of the dance.


Thank you for the opportunity to have my voice heard.

Thank you all,
Amaury

Amaury asks ; (thank you Amaury for stimulating an
interesting discussion):

"I do have a question to our group.  Lets for a
minute,
for the sake of
conversation, accept the argument supporting national
origin as a factor
influencing artistic performance.  Would the same
apply to music playing and
composing?

If so, than Yo-Yo Ma is a hell of an Argentine.

Cheers,
Amaury "

It is precisely in the music where the Argentine
character is expressed the 
most.

It is obvious that one of the most important ancestors
of tango is the 
Milonga. The early tangos were very similar to the
milonga. Even today some 
of those primitive tangos such as "el Porteqito",
"El Esquinazo" or "El Entreriano" are frequently
thought to be milongas 
abroad.

La milonga was born in rural areas where the main
entertainment of the 
gauchos was to gather around a fire and play the
guitar.

They had verbal competitions in which one of them
would improvise lyrics, 
usually in the form of a question, on a certain theme
( philosophical 
subjects such as love, life, death, God, fate, etc) as
he accompanied 
himself with the guitar. Another cowboy would answer
in verse as well.

This is still done in rural areas, mostly as part of
the celebration of 
national holidays, along with rodeos.

Blacks listening to this form of "rap" baptized this
event with one word of 
their African Language
"Milonga" meaning "palabrerio" too many words.  This
original meaning od 
milonga is still used in slang, when somebody comes
with a long  complain he

is told "ok, do not came now with that milonga".

In time this guitar playing at the "Payadas" (this is
the name of the verbal

verse competition), was followed by dancing to the
guitar rhythm, (this 
dancing, was also called milonga) and later on the
place where the payada 
and the dance took place was also called 'Milonga".

This is the reason we still  go to the "Milonga"
today.

Gauchos (cowboys) would bring cattle to the city of
Buenos Aires and 
Montevideo and camp in the outskirts where the
slaughter houses where 
placed.  It was in this periphery of the city where 
the rural milonga 
interacted with other rhythms brought by immigrants
from Spain (Tanguillo, 
something like Flamenco) or by sailors from the
Caribbean (Habanera) and

and even the Zamba".

This is getting to be too long so I will stop here for
now.

Nobody says that you have to dance like an Argentine;

     An interesting argument were this 1920, perhaps,
but then that primitive coal of a dance went through
decades of crunching in the milongas of Buenos Aires,
the Golden Age, etc., finally emerging as the diamond
we know today as Argentine tango, so to pretend that
that diamond is anything but Argentina's culture is
patent nonsense.

     On the other hand, I think it's also nonsense
to think that nobody but an Argentine can dance
"world-class" (whatever that is supposed to mean)
Argentine tango.  But tango is Argentine (rioplatense
for the sticklers), and the overwhelming majority of
the best dancers do happen to be Argentines who have
been dancing for many years.

     The best teachers are also Argentine.  But of
course that does not mean that simply being Argentine
guarantees that you'll be good, far from it.

Hi,

While many have claims have been made, and we do not really have
copious amounts of primary documents for incontrovertible proof of one
hypothesis over another, I think that we can still (A) identify and
separate obvious biases that got woven into the narrative, as well as
claims that are made to reinforce or conform to the preferred
narrative (B) separate less systematic analyses and famous people's
opinions from more systematic analyses and (C) distill more probable
from less probable realizations.

In regards to biases and prejudices influencing the narrative, it
seems quite self-evident now that (1) tango originated with the
working classes, and because of that (2) high-society argentines did
not accept it at first because of class prejudice. What the upper
class did then was the usual for the times with their racial and class
prejudices - it claimed that tango is dirty, born in brothels,
practiced by homosexuals, ugly/unseemly dirty scandalous dance, etc. I
am not even saying that they were willfully lying - it must have
seemed that way to them because this is how they saw low class people
- they had to be dirty and into any sin in fashion at the time. BTW,
this was not some peculiarly Argentine behaviour - the same patterns
stemming from racial and/or class prejudices can be seen elsewhere.

Later, when tango was forced on the upper class by Paris, it became
imperative to reject any black influence in it because of racism.
Separately, because Europeans were titillated with 'exoticism', with
'natives' and 'authenticity', whole storylines were invented about
gauchos (being identified with Argentina the most) being the
dancers/creators of tango, and tango performers in Europe were
apparently required or encouraged to dress in what was thought to be
gaucho dresses. Also the pimp/whore or knife-wielding dangerous
man/devoted woman as a dancing couple, which seems to have  been
borrowed as a narrative directly from the french 'apache'
dance/performance that also originated within low class people in
Paris at about the same time tango was exported there.

To see how strongly the upper class (Argentines and Europeans)
influenced the narrative, to this day we still hear about tango
described as exotic, sexual, born in brothels (very very unlikely and
frankly nonsensical). It did not help that tango celebrities were
reinforcing or conforming to that over the last few decades - for
example Piazzolla's 'tango is vertical rape', or perhaps he was
quoting a poet or someone else.

So we throw in famous people expressing opinions, quoting poets, or
re-re-re-telling anecdotes found in books that were not systematic
analyses of primary sources as much as one can find them. I am not
saying that oral history is not important - it is extremely valuable,
but it has to be balanced with a systematic investigation whenever
possible.

>From what I have read, it seems to me the most probable story has the
working class creating tango in conventillos in Buenos Aires, in the
inner yard while socializing in the evening, just like with other
nations that had traditional gatherings every night and almost
everyone could play an instrument or dance or recite a poem or tell a
story, and dances and songs were created, and that's where things were
generally happening..

Of course tango might have been danced (not created) in brothels, just
like other dances were danced there or in US brothels - whatever was
popular, people will dance it.

There seems to be a confusion also about dancing halls versus
brothels, with a tendency to conflate one with the other, which might
be part of establishing the whole 'dancing in brothels'  idea to an
extent larger than it might have been happening. Dancing halls (and
dancing) were big everywhere in the world at the time (turn of the
century to the big depression). These came in various configurations,
some with taxi dancers (which was a perfectly respectable profession).
That's apparently who you would give chips to to dance with, with
typically half going to the owner. This seems to have been corrupted
into 'paying a prostitute to dance with at brothels' or at least it
bears a disturbing similarity to it. I am talking here about Europe
and the US, not just Argentina.

As an aside, the term 'gigolo' meant a taxi dancer, and the female
counterpart would be a 'gigolette'. Rudolf Valentino was a gigolo,
i.e. a taxi dancer in a dancing hall, when he was discovered by the
film industry. There is some evidence that 'gigolo' acquired its
'dirty' connotations later, as a result of either (i) some gigolos
branching into expanded services, or especially (ii) the societal
stigma of a man getting paid by women thus his job/profession being
dishonourable, or likely both.

Then there are some confusions in terminology or context.

The milongas before 1930 came in several flavours - most famously the
milonga campera, a slow, 3-3-2 pattern, sung by payadores accompanied
by guitar, but also some 2/4 livelier tunes, yet none of them had
anything to do with the post-1930 milonga as we know it.

However the post-1930 milonga and the pre-1920 tangos share the
habanera rhythm pattern of dotted eight-sixteenth-eight-eight, which
is why Sergio could say that some outside Argentina confuse early
tangos (in pre-1920 arrangement) with post-1930 milongas. This cannot
be an argument about the primacy of milonga, though - at least not
about the milonga as we know it now.

This is my current opinion about various myths and concepts to do with
tango history and influences. It is all subject to correction and
refinement. It is also important to realize that I am not making
absolute claims here. but more in the sense of most likely, or most
supported by systematic analysis or evidence, or most common.

With best regards,

Dear Igor,

Someone wrote a whole PhD on these drum lines (or was it D.Mus.); I
just have to find my notes and the materials at home. Will follow up
soon.

Message-ID: <20070718181108.38D0122D5E@p3fed1.frb.org>

As I see it, there are four layers of tango learning (from the top to the 
foundation).

4) Step Patterns and Choreographies
3) Structure of the Dance
2) Quality of Movement
1) Rhythm - the foundation

For each layer there are levels of mastery--beginning, intermediate, 
advanced, etc.  Instructors are likely to classify their classes by the 
levels of mastery, rather than by layer--with most instructors offering 
instructton in step patterns.

Without sufficient mastery of the skills in the underlying layers, 
learning at higher layers is relatively meaningless.  In particular, 
learning many step patterns or mini choreographies without the underlying 
layers is like building a castle in the sky.  Students who study with the 
all-too abundant StepMeisters without knowledge of the underlying layers 
are simply buying more bricks for their imaginary castle.  Many of the 
people who take workshops year after year without ever learning to dance 
tango probably fall into this category.

The style of tango is really independent of these layers; but many 
milonguero-style teachers emphasize rhythm and small elements of the 
dance; many salon-style teachers emphasize step patterns and the quality 
of movement; many of the nuevo-style teachers emphasize mastery of a 
structural knowledge; and nearly all the technique instructors emphasize 
the quality of movement.  A heavy reliance of any one element in these 
elements is likely to result in only a partial knowledge of tango, and in 
students who are only capable of dancing in an imitation of the same style 
as their instructors.  If the instructor is but an imitation of another, 
that makes the student an imitation of an imitation.  That may be why so 
many of the Argentines who teach tango claim only dead masters as being 
their instructors.

So I have some understanding for Chris' claim that nearly all tango 
instruction is worthless, and Nina's assertion that only Argentines can be 
masters of tango.  If we examine more closely Tete's comments "Organizers 
[in the United States] get anybody they can to come and teach.  But 
because this is a business, its work for these dancers, they don't come to 
teach you tango, they come to teach you steps. ... And if you really think 
about it, the music is tango; it's not the steps.  Whatever style of dance 
you dance the music always comes first.  So what happens, if a teacher 
comes here and they sell you steps instead of teaching how to dance, what 
happens?  You don?t dance.  You learn steps because that is what you think 
you need to learn." 

With best regards,
Steve

Hi Steve, Tete's perspective (as I gathered from attending his classes) 
boils down to "I can dance tango" (shows some dancing) "but you are not 
doing it right". I congratulate you on your wonderful success. Being 
instrumental in half of your students being able to dance well in the 
milongas in six weeks is nothing short of phenomenal.

>Teaching beginning tango as walking and as small elements of movement
>creates the possibility of emphasizing the rhythm of the music.

True that. We do that all the classes we teach.

>beginning students can assemble these small movements to dance.

Not necessarily. Actually it's highly unlikely that the beginning student 
can do any such thing.

>After the students have mastered some basic rhythmic and movement skills,
>learning something about the underlying structure of the tango would be
>helpful.

Here is the crux of the problem. Mastering basic rhythmic and movement 
skills is most difficult for the average person who walks into a tango 
class. IMHO, if a dancer has mastered basic rhythmic and movement skills, he 
or she is already a master dancer and is probably teaching classes 
somewhere. I think that the key to this whole argument is how one defines 
"mastering rhythmic and movement skills" or just what makes a given person a 
"passable dancer" on the pista....


>Along the way, some refinement of movement is good.

I'd say along the way the refinement of movement is the key to mastering the 
"rhythmic" and "movement" skills. Maybe I'm a bit of a curmudgeon, but I 
totally disagree with many people's definition of "mastering" various skills 
of dancing. Actually, "mastering" rhythmic movement (or dancing to the 
music, if you will), is a rare quality among dancers. There are very few 
dancers who actually have any "mastery" of that. On top of that, "mastery" 
of navigation is also very difficult and rare to see. I think it's 
disingenuous to say that beginner dancers can master anything is six weeks 
(or even six months). Again, maybe my definitions of "mastery" and "skill" 
are way off base, but I can only talk based on my experience and 
observations over the years.

Cheers,

Manuel

Thanks for this.

I also noticed that Sergio ran together the categories of historical  
milongas from the previous century with our modern concept of milonga  
which dates from the 1930s.  As you say, there are very few primary  
sources that allow us to figure out the exact truth when we go back  
before the 1920s.


"Brothel" may or may not be the same thing as "Dance Hall" or  
"nightclub". One would assume that men met women at locations that  
varied from respectable to dis-reputable, and from high-class to low- 
class. One would assume that women were protected, controlled or  
allowed freedom, paid or not paid depending on numerous factors. In a  
culture of extreme poverty and wealth, the difference between a  
prostitute, mistress, and girlfriend may also be ambiguous.

Certainly, wealthy "jailaifs" would go "slumming" in downtown  
nightclubs, which to me presumes (but doesn't prove) that there was  
tango in brothels at least in the occasional sense.

Dear Steve,

I would just add that in my opinion in your first layer it is not just
rhythm but rhythm and the _music_, the understanding of which is
ultimately the key.

Manuel and all:

I have to say that Tete's own skills as an instructor nothing to do with 
the validity of his comments.  I didn't find his instructional videos to 
be much different than the classes Manuel describes.  It's his power of 
observation that is worth considering.

Previously I wrote:
>>beginning students can assemble these small movements to dance.

Manuel responded:
>Not necessarily. Actually it's highly unlikely that the beginning
>student can do any such thing.

Maybe it's a question of teaching how to assemble those elements.

It might also be a case of my defining passably differently than you 
define mastery.  I'm not suggesting that such dancers have reached the top 
level in 6-8 weeks.  I am saying that they would show some competence in 
basic movement, rhythm and navigation, and have fun without getting in 
anyone else's way.

I'm still struck by a comment that Tom Stermitz made a few years ago that 
people show up at their first tango lesson with navigational skills and 
maybe some basic knowledge of rhythm,.  (They are able to walk down a 
crowded street or through a crowded mall without colliding with anyone.) 
After their first tango lesson--which typically consists of learning a 
memorized step pattern--many would be tango dancers have no connection to 
the music and have no ability to navigate.  That description doesn't 
recommend instruction very much does it?

With best regards,
Steve

Dear Tom,

Thank you for great comments. In regards to your last sentence
(above), I just wanted to make it clear that what I consider a myth is
the claim that tango _originated_ or was _born_ in brothels. That it
was subsequently danced there - more or less occasionally, is fairly
likely or perhaps even documented (although one can question the
definition of 'brothel' or the provenance of the evidence, or the
motive of the source). However, there is a very significant difference
between that and the claim that it originated there.

I just think that it is time to put some of these well-worn myths to
bed. To me the likely real story (as I indicated in my previous
posting) is so much more interesting, tender, and beautiful than the
tired cliches about prostitution, violence, and exoticism.

With best regards,

Hi,

After reading everyones responses my post about Acrimoniousness...

"You can tell a fool he's doing a foolish thing, it may not change  
anything, but at least the truth is where it needs to be". - Kosh,  
Vorlon Ambassador, Babylon 5.

Oh and one thing about list moderation, the list moderator in my  
estimation in question isn't doing a good job of list moderation if  
they're acting like that.  A good list moderator, shepherds the  
conversation and doesn't stifle it!  That's a rare skill and not  
everyone is cut out for it, so its wise when starting a list to pick  
someone ELSE other than yourself to moderate a list.

Lastly, I find it interesting that you folks took the better portion  
of my note and discarded it in favor of focusing on the one thing  
that was an after thought, the list moderation.  As a friend of mine  
once said, "People are gonna do what they're gonna do, and you can't  
change that.  But you can influence them by how you carry yourself."

What makes you believe, it was the "working" class? I rather believe 
someone working 10-12 hours a day as usual at the end of the 18th 
century cannot spend too much time hanging around and dancing. It was 
certain the lower class, but it is more likely they were not working, 
unless you define any kind of money earning as work, not much difference 
today in BA, where you see the same guys night after night in all 
milongas from 0 to 5 am. You see people with ordinary daylight jobs only 
at the weekend and maybe once between Mo and Fr.
I don't believe it is useful to describe tango history in terms of 
marxist dialectic.

I don't have to believe; it is what makes most sense and it is what
was done in other countries in similar circumstances. That was
ordinary people's entertainment. You have to remember the 1900s was an
era without radio, television, movies, or recorded music of any kind.
Secondly, do not assume long hours or hard work meant no fun and play
in the evening; people are amazingly resilient and adaptive even under
most difficult conditions. A friend likes to say that they composed
tangos even in Auschwitz. I don't know if this is true, but it is
perfectly plausible because this is the nature of people.

Wow, give me a break! It never occured to me that this term also has
marxist relevance. In any case (1) I obviously used it interchangeably
with "low class", and (2) as it turned out after I did google searches
it is in general usage where 2/3 of the time it is used outside any
socialist/marxist context. Also, do you know that the term "low class"
is used 3-4 times less often than "working class" (outside marxist
context)?

I guess I should have kept saying "low class", and then get trashed by
someone else.

Subject: [Tango-L] To moderate or not to moderate... be aware of Miles
	argument
Message-ID: <893488.70563.qm@web62509.mail.re1.yahoo.com>

My first experience with list moderation date as far
back as 1993-4 with the
KMUG (Kansai Mac Users Group) list.  At the end of the
day moderation was as
detrimental to the list as non-moderation.

One of the rationales behind list moderation is
sustenance of an online
community.  Implicit in this argument is the idea that
constant disruption
and flame war is likely to push certain members to
leave the community thus
eroding the quality of membership and content of
postings.

The bottom line for me is the 'age' of a list.  That
is, an old established
list with strong membership and displaying high
quality posting may not be
susceptible to the eroding effects of flame and
disruption.  It seems to me
that this list's quality FAR exceed the once in a
while virulent posting of
some listeras. ;)

Some flames evolve into rich discussion and edifying
exchanges.  Nina's
abhorrent posting is a good case in point.  I learned
as a result of an
initial nonsensical posting - (thank you to
Konstantin, Huck, and all
others) 

A censored list may strip the list of its richness of
expression.  Granted
we should all try to display certain level of
civility.   However, I must
say that the entertainment value of some postings
bring a smile to my face.
That alone makes it all worthwhile.  

Cheers,
Amaury

Hi,

After reading everyones responses my post about
Acrimoniousness...

"You can tell a fool he's doing a foolish thing, it
may not change  
anything, but at least the truth is where it needs to
be". - Kosh,  
Vorlon Ambassador, Babylon 5.

Oh and one thing about list moderation, the list
moderator in my  
estimation in question isn't doing a good job of list
moderation if  
they're acting like that.  A good list moderator,
shepherds the  
conversation and doesn't stifle it!  That's a rare
skill and not  
everyone is cut out for it, so its wise when starting
a list to pick  
someone ELSE other than yourself to moderate a list.

Lastly, I find it interesting that you folks took the
better portion  
of my note and discarded it in favor of focusing on
the one thing  
that was an after thought, the list moderation.  As a
friend of mine  
once said, "People are gonna do what they're gonna do,
and you can't  
change that.  But you can influence them by how you
carry yourself."

Ok...  Nina,

You are a living example that Tango transcends the
boundaries of
'Argentiness'.  I quick Google search show that you
are a very successful
and talented RUSSIAN tanguera.  See
http://tangoledanza.com/aboutus.aspx

Proof that one does not need to be Argentine to be a
master.  Hopefully one
day we can tango together ;)  If you dance as well as
you flame I am in for
a night of fun !!!

Abrazos,
Amaury

Miles,  don't read this!  It is totally uncivilized!


I am on my knees begging forgiveness of all the
well-educated, 
well-informed, super sensitive, delicate beings on
this list who do 
not bother to contribute to the world of tango
knowledge except when 
mortally offended.

And I take full credit for making people like Amaury
so outraged that 
their little voices are finally heard roaring
defending the history, 
the great maestros, and the glorious history of tango
and its 
rhythms!  And they manage to offend most Argentines by
claiming that 
tango is not an Argentine product!  Such gorgeous
idealism and 
ignorance makes me misty...

Hey folks, in case those of you who have been dancing
for a decade or 
two do not know, Argentine Tango is European!

You go, Amaury!  I am cheering you on!

Nina
Arrogant, abnoxious and bored-to-tears

P.S. Universal art form?!  I swear that these greedy
foreigners just 
want to make my Argentine Tango their own!

Dear Steve,

In your very nice post you say "After the students have mastered some basic 
rhythmic and movement skills, learning something about the underlying 
structure of the tango would be
helpful.". You also said that back when you were teaching with Susan (give 
her my cordial greeting), you were producing "passable dancers" in about six 
to eight weeks of 1 hour weekly lessons.

By definition in some dictionaries, "mastery" means:
1. Possession of consummate skill
2. Full command of a subject of study
3. Status of master or ruler

"passable" is defined as:
1. of moderate quality but less than excellent
2. satisfactory but not outstanding; adequate

Please do not think I'm passing judgment on your teaching skills. But in all 
honesty, it's extremely rare for a six~eight week trained dancer to have 
mastered anything. In my humble opinion, a great number of dancers who've 
been dancing for years fall in the passable category. Even after many 
classes and workshops with excellent teachers, few people attain "mastery" 
of the basic tango dance.

I agree with Jake. He said something about the students lack of mastery is 
due to his not being able to practice for them. I firmly believe that lots 
of practice can help attain mastery. A dose of natural talent does not hurt 
either. But lets be honest, how many beginning students will take lessons 
and practice enough in six to eight weeks to actually learn to lead or 
follow and dance rhythmically?

Tom Stermitz is right in that people walk into a tango class but promptly 
forget how to do it by the end of the class.... However, this is only 
partially correct. It does not give the true picture of what happens. They 
might walk into the class, but generally, they are totally unaware of their 
body. Most folks have a hard time shifting their weight from one foot to the 
other when asked to do it... Ever notice how they always end up with their 
weight over both feet whenever they stop moving? Have you ever had to teach 
a woman to be aware of the lead so she moves her legs instead of falling 
backwards when you try to lead her to walk? Ever see a man start by stepping 
on their partner's feet before even moving their bodies or giving a lead? 
Ever notice how you can easily spend on hour trying to teach control of 
simple movements to one person?

I've seen those scenarios literally thousands of times. Teaching people to 
move consciously and deliberately by themselves in a non-familiar way (think 
tango) is not easy. When you try to teach 2 inexperienced people to do that 
*together* you will have an exponentially more difficult task. I challenge 
the notion that such people can become "passable" dancers after six or eight 
lessons of one hour, given once a week....

You talk about teaching how to "assemble these elements". I say good luck in 
teaching them the element of leading and following in six weeks, let alone 
assembling elements of rhythm, timing and body control. Like I said, if one 
has "mastery" of even the most basic tango skills, one is a "Master", well 
past the passable level. BTW, if you want to see passable, just go to any 
large milonga and watch the people dance. You'll be amazed at the number of 
passable dancers you'll see, and they will not be all students with six 
weeks of one hour/week lessons under their belts.

Sincerely,

Manuel

Message-ID: <380-22007731820494026@M2W014.mail2web.com>

In virtually all discussions of the origins of tango, I am surprised at the
lack of mention of the apache (a-pa-shay).  The apache appeared as a
vernacular street dance in Paris  in all likelihood in the mid- to
late-1800's, possibly even pre-dating the appearance of tango in Buenos
Aires.  The story of the apache was that it also supposedly started as a
dance between pimps and prostitutes among "immigrants," though from rural
France and not another country.  Furthermore, a dance with an embrace that
is unmistakably like tango appears in a Renoir painting of Paris from 1876.
And Rudolph Valentino, mentioned earlier, started as a taxi dancer of the
apache, not the tango.
Paris and Buenos Aires had close ties early. The presumption that the early
influence of tango was unidirectional from Buenos Aires to Paris may not be
appropriate.  It may in fact be difficult to say which influenced which the
most with regard to the development and evolution of tango, among many
other sources.

Hi Manuel and everyone:

If we are to parse words, some mastery of basic skills means a less than 
mastery.

If passable requires some mastery of basic skills, 6-8 weeks is completely 
possible.

Far from finding a judgement on my teaching skills, I read a criticism of 
other teachers.  Students need to be taught enough in a beginning course 
that they are encouraged to keep dancing.  If the emphasis is on teaching 
small elements and basic rhythmic skills, they will find the ecouragement. 
 Will they be prepared to join the Tango X 2 company?  No.  Will they be 
prepared to go to local milongas and have a good time?  Yes.  Having a 
good time may launch them into the learning and practice that is necessary 
to move beyond passable.

Jake is completely right that the instructors cannot practice for the 
students.  Those who want to become dancers find it within themselves to 
practice.

Why do students who study for years never progress beyond passable?  Read 
my other posting.
http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2006/msg05241.html

 IMO, too many teachers foster a dependence on their teaching.  When Susan 
and I were teaching regularly, we often told our students that we had 
taught them enough and they should practice and just dance to refine 
skills.  We also hosted a guided practice, and that is where I still think 
the students really learned to dance.

With best regards,
Steve

Nope. It was not popular because it was not regular.  Heck, the Russians 
were doing it and Luigi Madonis (1690 - 1767), a pupil of Vivaldi wrote 
a piece in 5/8. Many, many great old hymns and chants are in anything 
other than regular meter. One that pops into my mind is a choral  by 
Phillip Nikolai (1556 - 1608) in 13/8, written it was said after the 
Plague had wiped out almost everyone else in his town. The point is that 
common folks running around a long time ago often wrote very irregular 
music. It is a fiction that nobody knew about it until Africans 
introduced it. Generally it came about in an attempt to mimic very 
closely the rhythms of speech, which are notoriously irregular. (There 
was even a very highly developed theory on this in the spoken word in 
the Baroque and I remember a particularly intriguing class based on the 
writings of Georg Lessing as applied to Shakespeare -- much more 
dramatic done that way.) Africans just made it a whole lot more fun and 
sexier which does wonders for anything's acceptance.

As for a very famous example -- which has no influence at all from 
African rhythms -- look no further than the driving 1st movement of 
Holst's "The Planets -- Mars, the Bringer of War." It not merely is in 
5/4 but also has hemiolas in  5/2 at the same time. Listen to that and 
you will pick up on the "limping" feeling it gives and then you will be 
a bit more likely to perceive it in other music. Try to march to it. 
You'll see. [Footnote: One of the most beautiful pieces written is 
Rachmaninoff's "Isle of the Dead" in 5/8. Get the old Fritz Reiner 
recording. Very sad and tango-like in its ethos.]

NOTE: Tango rhythms are syncopated but within a regular framework. You 
will find driving 2/4 pieces with 3+3+2 (candombe) rhythms all over the 
place, but this is very different from a piece written using 5/8 as the 
main time signature which is too irregular to dance to. People who are 
not too familiar with music gets this wrong all the time. Snarky 
comment: Doesn't matter because they also tend to ignore it and dance it 
regularly anyway...

One more cultural aside for those slightly bewildered people from 
Argentina. There have been many instances of African influence in 
American culture. Up until the 1960's when the Civil Rights movement 
came into full swing these influences were completely and unjustly 
ignored. The style of corrective scholarship, as we may call it, that 
came into being tended to overstate the case to make it at all (does 
anyone remember the serious attempts to prove Beethove was Black?) This 
looks very odd to non-Americans who are a lot more comfortable with 
their history. Case in point is that quirky book by Robert Farris 
Thompson "Tango the Art History of Love" which leaves one with the 
distinct impression that tango is all but an African dance and that 
nobody white danced tango until very recently.

Cheers,

Jeff G

Hi,

I did mention the apache, just today. However the apache may have
influenced not the tango dance, but the myths about tango.

And yes, there was no implicit claim from me that Valentino was a
_tango_ taxi dancer, I just mentioned him as an example of a taxi
dancer.

Lastly, that tango was exported to Paris (and not the other way
around) is, more or less, a non-controversial statement backed up by
documents. As to the interaction between Paris and Buenos Aires, there
is a very interesting systematic account of the comings and goings of
Latin Americans between 1880-1920 in a PhD dissertation by Ingrid Fey.

With best regards,

Dear Steve,

I guess we can agree that "mastery" and "passable" have vastly different 
meanings to me and you. Perhaps it's my skill level in English. Please 
excuse it on the grounds that it's not my native language.

Also, I agree with you on that students need not become dependent on their 
teachers. Attending milongas and practicas is also the best way to refine 
and put into practice what one learns in the class. Again, you and many 
others are right in saying that the goal of learning the tango is to dance 
and have fun. And really, it's quite possible that a particular student 
might be ready to leave the teacher after a few weeks or months. After all, 
if one has taught them all one knows, there is nothing left to do but go 
elsewhere to learn more. ;-)

Sincerely,

Manuel

Subject: [Tango-L] Influence of European rhythms in the Tango
Message-ID: <1184793357.469e830d4e019@webmail.telus.net>

Konstantin Zahariev,

The influence of European rhythms in the Tango is via the Habanera (Spain). 
Pompeyo Camps draws a parallel between ragtime and tango in the way the USA 
black musicians utilized polkas and European rhythms in the formation of the 
ragtime to obtain a dual race type of music. In the same way, Argentines of 
black descendent received European influence from the Habanera in the formation 
of the first forms of Tango.

The result between ragtime and tango is the similarity of rhythms; the parallel 
is that early Tangos and Milongas have parts of cakewalks and ragtime music. 
The proof is in some of the music left behind by the pianist Manuel O. 
Campoamor a.k.a. "El Negro".

Another source of European influence in the tango dance is given by Jose 
Gobello, who explains that Tango was a peculiar way to dance Mazurca in the 
areas adjacent to the port in Buenos Aires.

This seems to be about US bands and seems to desribe ragtime. What are
you trying to say?

I was talking about working class families living in conventillos, and
gathering each night in the large interior yards to socialize, play
music, dance.

Maybe you missed Chris' post last year. Chris has actualy attended classes with more than 60 [yes, 60] different teachers. But he's never explained why he eventually decided they were worse-than-useless or why it took him so long to come to that conclusion. 

Since his dislike of teachers has no logic, I tend to think it's envy - after all, teachers are actually getting paid for what Chris would obviously be happy to do for free.

Piffle.

There is no "women's technique" per se.  There isn't a women's ocho and
a man's ocho, there isn't a man's cross distinct from a woman's cross,
there isn't a special man's molinete.  There isn't a different way of
walking forward for the man that doesn't also exist for the woman.  

Intuition does not exist in a vacuum.  It always builds on what you
already know.  No one starts tango with such "natural skill of movement"
they can start the dance right off without learning anything ... we all
learn everything from scratch.  If someone understands tango, then they
can communicate that understanding.  If the communication is successful,
then the recipient comes away with something they didn't have before. 
Sure, there are many teachers that have a poor intellectual framework
for communicating tango, even if they dance well.  But tango instruction
follows the 90/10 rule just like every other field, so it follows some
people care really good at teaching.

And what you learn, has to be practiced, over and over, tens of
thousands of times until it becomes part of your being, until it can
merge with the music coming through your heart.  "Just dancing" is not
practice, it's just dancing.  Practice involves doing the same thing
repeatedly with focused attention to train the body.  In other words, it
requires the discipline of foregoing the joy of "just dancing" right
now, so there can be more joy in "just dancing" later, because better
dancing *is* better fun.

Only the individual dancer can decide how much discipline they apply to
their dance.  But there is no tango without discipline, because there
*is* somewhere a line you cross between not tango and tango, and to be
dancing tango, you need to be on the tango side of that line.  And no
one knows all by their lonesome, if they are on the tango side of the
line.

I've danced with hundreds of women.  The ones that dance well, take
classes and private lessons and practice.  The ones that can't hold up
their end of the dance, with bad habits, no skills, no posture, no
balance and needing constant care, attention and management just walking
down the line of dance, too often are the ones who only show up at
milongas and expect guys to teach them what they need to know there. 
This isn't to say that there aren't many dancers beyond hope no matter
how much instruction they get; but they are fewer than most people
think.

Yes, tangos play with various rhythmic counterpoints, including 3-3-2  
and others.

It would be incorrect to say it is impossible to dance in 5. 5/8 is  
pretty fast, but 5/4 is certainly a dance rhythm. Eastern European  
dances often have very complex and fast rhythms.

The half-and-half is a well-known (or not) ballroom dance in 5/4 from  
the teens and twenties. It is fun to play a half-and-half for tango  
dancers and watch them figure it out after struggling for a little  
while.

Dear Manuel and others:

Let me clarify that I didn't send students away after 6-8 weeks.  (I have 
more to teach than that.)
I also never taught them everything I know.  I taught them everything that 
I was comfortable teaching, and they could learn.

There is a point at which any true student-teacher relationship must come 
to an end.  The teacher can take the student to the doorway, but it is up 
to the student to step through that doorway and become a dancer.  Perhaps 
taking such a philosophy to an extreme in the few lessons and classes that 
he taught, jazz pianist Bill Evans refused to show his students the chord 
voicings and progressions for which he was renown because he did not want 
to deprive them of the opportunity to discover the knowledge on their own.

By the way, I don't consider someone whose instruction consists soley of 
demonstrating step patterns to be a teacher.  Of course, one can take many 
workshops and classes from StepMeisters, but they aren't really teaching 
tango.  They are simply demonstrating patterns within tango that they 
enjoy using.  Such classes can be an enjoyable diversion, but anyone who 
wants to convert what is taught in such classes into skills useful for 
dancing tango will have to work at it.

With best regards,
Steve

Dear Bruno,

Tango borrowed the cuban habanera rhythm pattern. The spanish habanera
is derived from the cuban habanera as it came to Spain and got adopted
there.

Secondly, ragtime itself is connected to West African and Haitian drum
lines (time lines). I am not sure what we are arguing about here. As
far as I remember, I did not claim that there has never been any
influence from Europe on the development of the musical form; my
comments were in the strict context of replying to claims about
influences of european  _rhythms_ on tango.

We should also separate the development of the musical form from the
development of the dance form. Some of your examples below are about
the dance form which I have thoughts on but have not addressed.

Lastly, you say "early Tangos and Milongas have parts of cakewalks and
ragtime music.". As far as I can tell there were no milongas in the
sense of post-1930 milonga, and the ones before that were folk music
forms not associated with tango.

As to cakewalk, you may be referring to the popular
sixteenth-eight-sixteenth note combination. That one is actually
present in several countries (Cuba, Brazil, USA) and, if memory
serves, in many national/popular dances and it can all be traced,
again, back to west african/haitian drum time lines.

Unfair, Steve. I've never claimed nearly all tango instruction is worthless.

Nor would I. It is worth a great deal to the tango economy hereabouts. For 
example the great time I had DJing and dancing at our largest festival 
this year was in no small part thanks to the income from the thousands of 
workshop places that make the event financially viable.

That's why I do not at all welcome Sean's recommendation that cheated 
class students should "walk out and demand your money back". If they all 
did that, the entire tango economy would collapse overnight.

;) ;)

 The woman with technique can make an ocho to d?Arienzo feel different than
an ocho to diSarli. That?s technique. It?s not about whether she can execute
ochos without touching the wall or putting weight on her partner. There are
actually times when my partner can put weight on me and it works in the
music, or the mood or the meaning. There are times when putting or
withholding weight can communicate a lot more than executing a perfect ocho.
 
This is how the dancers speak in the dance.

The woman with technique can show her partner a nuance in the music he might
never have noticed. And she can pick up on the messages he sends. What is he
hearing and leading to? It's an Alice in Wonderland adventure for a woman
with technique.

Just a couple of thoughts to add to the mix,

Robin

Instead of jumping into a pointless discussion about European influence on
Argentine Tango,
can anyone point to the good video records of Tango made in Europe before
1950? ( preferably 1910-1930 ). It was not what is now Ballroom tango - that
is for sure.

Amaury, you should know some..

Please, let us see what it is, what music they played, before making any
far-reached conclusions.

Dear Jeff,

I appreciate your examples. Perhaps I should not have mentioned a time
signature, as this was really irrelevant to the point I was making
about the suspected morphing of the 3-long block into a 2-long block
in the habanera in the process of oral transmission of music by
sailors and other travellers. I don't think providing some examples of
possibly related irregular rhythms in eastern Europe and elsewhere
necessarily discounts the possibility that this process occurred.

I have also not claimed that 5/8 and other irregular rhythms only came
from Africa or that they did not exist anywhere else. This would be an
absurd claim for me as I am Bulgarian by birth, and for me it is
natural to function in compositions in 5/8 (2-3), 7/8 (2-2-3 or 2-3-2
or 3-2-2), 9/8 (2-2-2-3), 11/8 or whatever else irregular rhythms you
may think of. I consciously excluded a discussion of the
Bulgarian/Balkan contribution to that as the context was tango (and
western Europe). In that regard, your Russian examples are also not
completely on point geographically..

A separate point is that it matters how the rhythm pattern or accents
are spaced. The time signature by itself does not provide that
information. So it is possible to have a piece in 5/8 or 5/4 that is
fundamentally different from a 5/8 or 5/4 piece that has a 2-3 rhythm
division, i.e. only two accents (strong pulses) that come at uneven
intervals. Another example, in Bulgaria a 9/8 would commonly be a
2-2-2-3 division (4 accents, irregular), whereas a 9/8 in western
Europe would commonly be  3-3-3 division, waltz-like and perfectly
regular.

I agree that the 3-long 2-long blocks are likely to have to do with
speech patterns. I also agree with the substance of your last
paragraph about the tendencies in first completely discounting and
later seemingly over-stating the black influence. We seem to be moving
towards a more objective view, however.

Subject: [Tango-L] 1930s - Argentine musicians in Russia?
Message-ID: <7.0.1.0.0.20070718161909.01b948e8@earthnet.net>

Dear dancers and musicians,

Does anyone know anything about Argentine tango musicians possibly 
travelling to Russia and actually recording therein the 1930s or so?

There is a recording of Russian tangos (not Leshenko) by an orchestra 
that I swear had both Russian and Argentine musicians.  I was told by 
my parents that one of those tangos is called "Splashes of Champaign" 
(Not the same tango as "Champaign Tango" recorded by Canaro in 1938).

Grisha (Gregory Nisnevich, the amazing guitarist that plays with 
Julio and Corina, who is on this list as well) said that to record in 
Russia during the Stalin's era the musicians had to be considered to 
be something very special. NOBODY was recording at that time, and yet 
we have these gems of recordings.  If some of these musicians were 
Argentine, then it would make sense that the music was considered to 
be special to be recorded.

Does anyone know anything about this?

Warmest regards,

Nina

I have no problem with that.  How do you get there, that's the question. 

I say lots of quality practice.

Other people, say, "no, it just sort of happens."  That's like telling
kids that babies come from the cabbage patch.

Konstantin Zahariev,

>From "La musica en Cuba", by Alejandro Carpentier, Fondo de Cultura Economica, 
Mejico 1967

.....When Argentina lost its blacks it needed that that the Tango rhythm return 
from Spain through the Zarzuela (Operetta or Musical Comedy) and from the 
Habanera edited in Europe giving form to what is its national dance.

Dear Bruno,

Tango borrowed the cuban habanera rhythm pattern. The spanish habanera
is derived from the cuban habanera as it came to Spain and got adopted
there.

Secondly, ragtime itself is connected to West African and Haitian drum
lines (time lines). I am not sure what we are arguing about here. As
far as I remember, I did not claim that there has never been any
influence from Europe on the development of the musical form; my
comments were in the strict context of replying to claims about
influences of european  _rhythms_ on tango.

We should also separate the development of the musical form from the
development of the dance form. Some of your examples below are about
the dance form which I have thoughts on but have not addressed.

Lastly, you say "early Tangos and Milongas have parts of cakewalks and
ragtime music.". As far as I can tell there were no milongas in the
sense of post-1930 milonga, and the ones before that were folk music
forms not associated with tango.

As to cakewalk, you may be referring to the popular
sixteenth-eight-sixteenth note combination. That one is actually
present in several countries (Cuba, Brazil, USA) and, if memory
serves, in many national/popular dances and it can all be traced,
again, back to west african/haitian drum time lines.

With best regards,

Konstantin

Oh, How? Hmmmm.

Assuming you can already execute a perfect ocho and giro. Presuming you
already have a passion for the music and you listen all the time. Presuming
you have already studied with all the best within your reach. Presuming you
already listen a lot, watch a lot and dance a lot. Presuming you are in
control of your own body, it then becomes an elusive game of trying to find
partners who can surprise you in the best of all possible ways. The goal is
to be able to start a conversation with any of your partners without
uttering a word.

You put in your hours in classes, and in the milonga and practicas, as well.
You take a few chances, dance with a few beginners, meet some folks who
dance in another part of the world. You travel, you listen, you watch.

Subject: [Tango-L] 1930s - Argentine musicians in Russia?
Message-ID: <00dd01c7c993$87581260$96083720$@com>

Nina,
Tango was the most popular dance in Europe from 1920 till 1950 and longer.
my uncle danced tango every weekend in 1950-1955 at parties at their house.
I know a woman who remembered dancing tango in Paris in 1944-1946. I knew a
man who danced tango in Ireland in 1920s 5 days a week !

I know that there was a lot of records of German, French, Polish, Russian
orchestras with good tangos. It seems to me Argentinean records got their
way to the European dance parties either. I have no idea that some of the
musicians were from Argentina. Probably not after 1930. Before - yes - even
Canaro was in Paris, right?

Where are those records
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just a handful remained.

Does anyone know about video of tango dance of the period 1910-1930
????????? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes, it seems to me the music was slightly different ( reminding of salon
Argentine Tangos of 1920s period ) and the dancing was probably different
either. But only videos could tell more about it. 

How about America? Armstrong introduced a little of Tango in one of his
earlier pieces. He wouldn't do it if it would be popular at some period
there.

Does anyone knows about other american tango records?

Subject: [Tango-L] Argentine Tango III
Message-ID: <BAY108-F10603AB5A4452AB173A21C97FA0@phx.gbl>

What is known about tango history is due to several sources, in particular  
from the police records of Buenos aires and Montevideo dating from early 
19th century when "Dances of Negroes" were regulated by the City Hall and 
frequently raided by the police. There are records dating 1808 forbidding 
Candombes and other dances of negroes.

The closeness of the dancers, the sensuality of its choreography says a lot 
about its origin in brothels in the suburbs of Buenos Aires. At a time when 
people did not dance in close embrace.
This is specially evident in the names and lyrics of the first tangos that 
we know:

Afeitate el 7 que el 8 es fiesta (de Antonio Lagomarsino).   Shave the 7 
because the 8 is holiday.
(in slang "shave your ass because tomorrow is a holiday").

Al palo! (de Eduardo Bolter Bulterini). Estar al palo significa 
experimentar una ereccin.

This is a reference to having an erection.

Most of the tangos of that time are a testimonial of its origin at the 
brothels. The lyrics are very explicit as it was its choreography.

Dos sin sacarla. Two without taking it out, etc, etc, etc.

It was due to this that decent families looked down on tango.

Poor families, working class families, middle class families and high class 
families ; all of them considered tango to be sinful and lewd.  They were 
right.

Who were the tango dancers? : outcasts and outlaws, unemployed men, pimps, 
criminals, compadritos, bullies, drug users, women prostitutes from Spain, 
France, Poland, France, etc.

Young men of high class started to patronize bars, gambling and dancing 
halls in the outskirts, to have some unusual fun.

It was they that purified the choreography in order to secretly teach it to 
their sisters and other female members of their family and later on it was 
they that took the tango to Europe.

It was this purified form of tango that was introduced to the European 
society who accepted and embraced it right away.  The name of those young 
men that traveled to Europe and taught tango are recorded in detail.

In the meantime in Buenos Aires "decent women" would not dance the tango in 
public, so men had to practice by themselves.  They practiced so that they 
could impress the women at the dancing halls later in the evening.

Tango (purified) became "tango liso started to be played and danced in the 
patios of the conventillos (boarding houses) and eventually in the home of 
all the families , finally it had become an acceptable form of 
entertainment.

Summary:  It is generally accepted that it originated in brothels as 
testified by its early choreography, lyrics, police records and some 
investigative reports such as that of  Mr. Carretero " Tango testigo social" 
  (Tango social witness). In his booklet Mr Carretero gives many examples of 
police and hospital records in this regard.

Tango has followed in its form and content every change in Argentine social 
evolution, the dance, the music and the lyrics as well.

Best regards, Sergio






La cercana de los bailarines y la sensualidad de su insinuante coreografa 
dice mucho sobre su origen prostibulario en los suburbios de Buenos Aires. 
Ms lo recuerdan los nombres de los primeros tangos que se conocen:

Afeitate el 7 que el 8 es fiesta (de Antonio Lagomarsino). Durante esos aos 
los tangos se publicaban como partituras para piano (en esa poca, en 
Argentina, muchas casas de clase media tenan un piano); en la cartula 
poda verse un almanaque en el que caa la hoja del da siete y se dejaba 
ver la del ocho. Pero en lunfardo siete era el nombre del ano; y hacerle 
el siete a alguien era penetrarlo analmente.
Al palo! (de Eduardo Bolter Bulterini). Estar al palo significa 
experimentar una ereccin.
Bartolo (milonga): Bartolo tena una flauta / con un aujerito solo, / y su 
mam le deca: / Dej la flauta, Bartolo! // Bartolo quera casarse / para 
gozar de mil placeres. / Y entre quinientas mujeres / ninguna buena 
encontr. // Pues siendo muy exigente / no hall mujer a su gusto, / y por 
evitar disgustos / solterito se qued.

El fierrazo (de Carlos Hernani Macchi), refirindose al acto sexual: Por 
salir con una piba / que era muy dicharachera, / me han quedado las orejas / 
como flor de regadera (las cursivas indican palabras censuradas).
El choclo (de ngel Villoldo): nombre de la mazorca de maz, pero que en 
lunfardo significa pene, por su forma flica). Algunos autores dicen que 
originalmente se llamaba ms explcitamente El choto.
El matambre (J. B. Massa. Podra tratarse de Juan Bautista Massa, compositor 
rosarino de msica clsica, pero no hay pruebas).
El movimiento continuo (de Oscar Barabino).
El 69 El 69 es la posicin en que el hombre y la mujer practican el sexo 
oral al mismo tiempo, es fcil ver la relacin entre tal posicin y el

El tercero (A. L. Fistolera Malli).

dibujo de la Luna. Pero se sobreentenda que se refera a la concha de la 
lora (una usadsima interjeccin vulgar de enojo o contrariedad, que se 
basa en una etimologa completamente olvidada en Argentina: a las 
prostitutas europeas se les deca loras). ste fue un tango muy conocido

recordados posteriormente.
Los nombres y las letras de estos tangos tuvieron que ser cambiados luego 
del golpe de estado del general Uriburu (la primera interrupcin de la vida 
constitucional en Argentina, en 1930, que inici la Dcada Infame, de corte 
represivo). Por ejemplo, Concha sucia se convirti en Cara sucia. Francisco 
Canaro se ocup de cambiarle la letra:

Cara sucia, cara sucia, cara sucia,
te has venido con la cara sin lavar
esa cara y tu sonrisa picarona,
que refleja una pasin angelical.
Cara sucia, cara sucia, cara sucia,
te has venido con la cara sin lavar
melenuda, melenuda, melenuda,
te has venido con el pelo sin peinar.
Recin a fines del s. XX los historiadores porteos recuperaron algunos de 
estos tangos (aunque slo los ttulos

Subject: [Tango-L] Argentine Tango, a "folk dancer's" perspective
Message-ID: <06DB1501-D421-4E83-AE03-AF7FD34209A9@charter.net>

Dear fellow Tango dancers (addicts),

I have read with interest, and at times amusement, the postings about  
the origins of the Tango, learning the Tango, ?world class? dancers etc.

Let me offer a Tango perspective, from the world of international  
folk dancing.

I have been a student of Argentine Tango (not American or  
International Ballroom) for three years. I consider it to be one of  
the most interesting ?folk dances? I have ever tried to master.

I consider it a folk dance, based on it?s origins. It did not start  
out being a dance taught by dance masters. It evolved by people  
dancing in a purely social context (with a wide range of dancing  
ability and styles). In this sense it is no different than many folk  
dances from all over the world.

True, it is one of those folk dances whose origin is primarily  
associated with an urban setting, not a rural village (Tango - urban,  
Chacarera - rural). The same thing can be said for dances like the  
Greek Hassapiko and the American, Ragtime, One Step (an interesting  
sister to the Milonga - different country and music, but similar  
rhythm and steps).

Unfortunately, far too often, something happens when dances move from  
being dances of the folk, to dances taught by dance masters. Now, I  
realize that I can not learn the Tango by growing up in Buenos Aires  
and going though a complex dance acculturation (beginning with my  
hearing Tango music as a fetus in the womb). I do have to rely on  
dance masters, listening to lots of music , and practice/practice/ 
practice. But when I dance Tango, I try to do it like a social folk  
dance, not a performance. My goal is to dance in a way that takes  
into account and respects:

1. The venue I am dancing in.

2. The music.

3. The other dancers on the floor.

4. My partner and myself (especially my partner).

5. The language of the dance (steps, syntax).

This allows for a wide range in variables like dancing ability and  
style.

I have had the experience, at social dances, of having someone tell  
me that I was doing something ?wrong? (different?).  If I am sure  
that I have respected 1-5 above, I usually say ?Thanks, but that?s  
the way they dance it in my village.? For Tango, I will substitute  
?neighborhood? for ?village,? more urban sounding.

Message-ID: <671257.44735.qm@web62514.mail.re1.yahoo.com>

Dear Igo,

I am sorry to disappoint you.  My knowledge of Tango
musical history is not
as sharp as yours.

For that very reason I have listen and learned much
from the 'experts' and
'scholars'.  I have however spoken of cultural
positioning, global
contribution to the development of art, national
identity and artistic
performance.  I will gladly engage and educate you off
the list ;)

As for my claim that Argentine disowned Tango just to
later reclaim it...
this remains unchanged.  Just look at how anxious
Argentines were to mimic
Paris architecture and urban design.  Parts of South
America have always
longed to resemble the old country.....  I am sure you
can understand with a
minimal intellectual effort. 

If not, a brief reading on the history of colonialism
in South America
should enlighten you.

Now... our friend Konstantin seems to be a good
source. Any comments on Igor
questions anyone???

Instead of jumping into a pointless discussion about
European influence on
Argentine Tango,
can anyone point to the good video records of Tango
made in Europe before
1950? ( preferably 1910-1930 ). It was not what is now
Ballroom tango - that
is for sure.

Amaury, you should know some..

Please, let us see what it is, what music they played,
before making any
far-reached conclusions.

Dear Bruno,

We can start a discussion about unsourced or poorly sourced claims
from books or monographs, especially when on subject peripheral to the
main subject, especially from decades ago. I am really not being
contrarian here, despite appearances, just sceptical in a scientific
sense. I am aware of contradictory claims from different books. That
is why I tend to rely more on scientific (peer-reviewed) papers and/or
dissertations and theses, whenever possible.

And look at this sentence: "When Argentina lost its blacks it needed
that that the Tango rhythm return from Spain..." - raising all sorts
of flags already. Then ..." from the Habanera edited in Europe" - this
is not even a contradiction with the claim that the tango borrowed the
cuban habanera rhythm pattern (yes the spanish habanera had it as
well, since the spanish habanera was a cuban habanera that made it to
Europe).

It may be a matter of labelling preference to you and me, but a music
that has a haitian/west african rhythm pattern is not evidence to me
for european influence on the rhythm pattern of the tango. If
anything, its presence in european music is just evidence for
haitian/west african influence on the europeans, not the other way
around.

In parting, I think I have spent way too much time today on this. I
have to get my materials out and go through them again when I find the
time.

With best regards,

Konstantin
Victoria, Canada

Dear Sr. Amaury,

There is no need for sarcasm. My questions were plain and straightforward.
Please, understand them as is:

1. Please, point to the good video records of Tango made in Europe before
1950. ( preferably 1910-1930 ). 
2. Please point to the place where I can get European tango collections of
the period 1910-1952.
( I am going to pay for them ).

The reason why I am asking is that I am very interested in that. I believe
tango was danced excellently in Europe, and music was quite good - good
enough for modern milongas.

I am so glad that you, Sr. Amaury, took some of your valuable time from
lectures and contributed to the list. May be now, knowing that you are a
real expert in tango and other cultural affairs, we can count on your
contribution to these simple and real-life questions.

I suppose you are in Europe now, so you can find answers to these questions
easier than others.

Thank you !

Igor Polk
PS These questions are not to a specific person, but to anyone who can
REALLY help me.

Dear Jeff,
Thank you for the great examples of 5/8 music !
I have listened to Rachmaninoff's "Isle of the Dead" just for a few seconds
on Amazon, and yes, it resembled tango for me ( remotely ). When I get the
complete records, I'll probably find out more about it.

"Isle of the Dead" was written in 1908 as far as I know. This is the time
when tango already appeared in Europe, and the idea that Rachmaninoff was
influenced by it should not be denied: first of all, he was a young man at
the time.

Let us take the slightly later time. European tango is darker. It was
propagated during and after the terrible WWI ( just 90 year ago, by the way
). Countries were falling apart, life itself was dark. Contrary to Argentina
at that time...

Subject: [Tango-L] 6 months or 6 weeks
Message-ID: <50946.1184822982@tangohk.com>

 After all the discussion about learning Tango in 6-months, we now have Stephen Brown who has it
 down to 6-weeks, with words like 'mastery' thrown in for good measure. What next - 6 days, with 
 perhaps a little less  'mastery'?

 And, why is everyone suddenly sooooooo polite? We have Manuel apologising for his poor English,
 when it's obvious to anyone that he was using the words 'mastery' and 'passable' correctly and it 
 was Stephen, presumably a native English' speaker, who was using them incorrectly.

 Even in his response, Stephen asserts ... "If passable requires some mastery of basic skills, 6-8 weeks
 is completely possible."

 Amazing. Stephen, I bow to your teaching skills.

What kind of dancing?  Tango only?  Where?  To what music?

In many countries people of all social classes engage in partner or solo 
dance as a means of recreation/entertainment, socializing, class and 
society identification, competition for a suitable mate, connecting with 
music and therefore with community and culture, and self expression. 
And, I'm sure, for other reasons.  (I tend to avoid referring to 
economic classes but sometimes economics primarily define social class 
in a society).

In some countries only people of certain social classes dance, for some 
or all of the same reasons.

Society in some countries includes dance as a critical self-identifier 
and part of the definition of the society's culture and a means of 
defining the "not us".  Perhaps the discussion on this list argues for 
Argentine tango as a critical self-identifier in the Argentine society, 
at least in the past, if not in the present.

In the US up through the 1940's dance was an integral part of everyday 
society.  People of all social classes danced.  (What they danced was 
very different; there was broad overlap but certain dances were 
identified predominantly with different social classes.)  There were 
barn dances, jook joints and dime-a-dance halls for the needs and 
purposes of the lower social classes, and dancing schools, social balls, 
and charity events with dancing for the higher.

Today in the US I would venture that there is far less dancing overall 
as entertainment options have vastly proliferated with the mass media. 
The social needs and purposes of people have changed and there are far 
less reasons to dance, apart from recreation and self expression. 
Dancing is minimally important overall, but where it exists it is more 
important to the higher social classes (educated and professional) and 
to ethnic groups reinforcing their subcultures.  It is not important at 
all to the public at large; it presents an unfamiliar curiosity (think 
Dancing with the Stars and So You Think You Can Dance).  I think the 
ethnic group phenomenon transcends social class.

I'm also interested in hearing what dancers in other countries and 
societies say about this.

References: <893488.70563.qm@web62509.mail.re1.yahoo.com>	<7.0.1.0.0.20070718142750.01b9cba0@earthnet.net>

Apparently the answer to Miles' query is that for some reason, in the 
online tango community, the dominant players generate and consume poison 
and unpleasantness as a form of entertainment.

They expect others to be wired the same way.  They feed on provocation 
and conflict and if it is not there in sufficient quantity, they will 
stir the pot.  They engage in display behavior by acting out their 
dominance and they award themselves self esteem points through bullying. 
  These self-esteem points are very easily obtained because everyone is 
remote and there are no social consequences to bullying or other bad 
behavior.

Accordingly, on tango-l there is no consensus (as there is generally in 
polite society) that to be acrimonious and impose your unpleasantness on 
others is morally wrong or stressful on a community, or even bad for 
your karma or your blood pressure.  To the contrary, it is celebrated. 
The community does not want a moderator because the community does not 
want to lose its primary form of entertainment.

It is unfortunate that the highest and most intellectual discussion of a 
particular human endeavor (tango) to be found, as on this list, requires 
subjecting oneself to the petty amusements of others who take their 
entertainment primarily in the form of bullying others, and who justify 
their mean and uncivilized behavior by claiming that it is actually a 
necessary expression of "passion and intensity."

When in Rome, be aware that Romans are going to continue being Romans.

This does not mean that you must be a Roman.

Carol,
 
     Excellent insight and summary. Only one point I might disagree on. I believe there is wide consensus on the list about flame behavior being judged wrong or inappropriate or unproductive. But in "polite society," when a person is obnoxious or boorish, people roll their eyes and turn away and ignore or shun them. In electronic society, the analogue is to not respond - "don't feed the trolls", or delete un-read any posts from repeat offenders. But those responses are invisible to the offender. It's easy enough to assume people aren't responding because of inability to come up with a good retort.

Message-ID: <20070719144521.846F8D4482@p3fed1.frb.org>

;-)  ;-)

IMNSHO, the standard approaches to teaching tango handicaps people in 
learning tango.  First the teachers teach the wrong material to beginners 
and then cover it up by pretending that learning the basics of tango is 
much harder than it is. 

Of course, the instructors have to cope with people who suddenly have 
brain freeze when they are confronted to moving to the music.  That is why 
it is important to break the dance into small rhythmic elements that can 
be learned by beginners.  (The 8-count basic and its derivatives promote 
brain freeze in beginners.)  That is also why not all of the students can 
learn to dance passably in 6-8 weeks, even when taught correctly--only the 
majority can.  (Okay, here I will concede that people attracted to tango 
in Dallas might be more rhythmically gifted than those in Atlanta and Hong 
Kong.)

How much additional work is required to move from passable competence to a 
higher level of competence and then mastery depends on a lot of 
factors--including how much time the would-be dancer puts into practicing, 
and how many wrong directions they get from their instructors.

My own experience as a beginner is relatively familiar:  In a two 
different series of classes that Susan and I took as beginners with two of 
the "great masters" we learned two different 32 step sequences complete 
with the prescribed embellishments.  We were "dancing" tango for about 
half a year before we had an instructor who helped us understand that the 
dance has an underlying structure from which the step patterns are 
created, and several years before someone really taught us a good 
understanding of the rhythm.  We were lucky that the latter two 
instructors came along.  Had they not, we might have remained among those 
thinking that they dance tango while remaining hopelessly trapped in 
unrhythmic patternitis. 

Sure tango instruction has changed since the early 90s--when Susan and I 
first started learning tango--but much of what passes for instruction 
remains rote learning "graded" sets of step patterns with some attention 
to the quality of movement, and nothing else.  We consider rhythm as the 
basis of tango and improvisation as one of its most important 
characteristics, but most instructors ignore rhythm and treat 
improvisation as an advanced topic.

With best regards,
Steve

Carol, Mash and everyone,

Perhaps some of you have not been on this list very long.  This list 
has not seen a single flame in YEARS.  There is a little poking and 
teasing, but no flaming. Criticism or disagreement is not 
flaming.  If you want to read real flaming on this list, then go back 
to the archives of 1997 or so.

This list is gentle and polite by comparison to what it used to be. 
Not only did it have real flames, but there was a much worse kind of 
flaming - in private e-mails.  That is why should this list ever see 
any flaming in the future, I encourage people to let others know that 
if they welcome their flames, they all have to be in the public forum 
and not via private communication.

On another note, if you think that you can be bullied on Internet, 
then how do you survive in your real life?  Does whining and 
complaining about the behavior of others without naming them gets you 
the results that you want?

Carols points demonstrate clearly a difference between direct 
aggression and passive aggression.  On this list, it appears that 
people accused of flaming are being directly aggressive towards other 
people and/or their ideas.  Passive aggression is expressed by others 
as hints and abstract ideas without ever naming anyone, but implying 
their identity.  I believe that this difference is cultural.  Even 
though both forms of aggression exist in all cultures, some cultures 
prefer the direct approach while others avoid direct confrontation 
without giving up their own aggression.

To me passive aggression is cowardly, so I probably would be more 
direct if flame wars ever returned to this list.  It is an issue of 
integrity - if I am willing to put my ideas forward, then I have to 
accept the risk that they will be unpopular.  I believe that other 
people have a right to express their disagreement with my ideas 
however it feels right to them, as long as it is legal.  My 
responsibility is to choose my own response.  Trying to control 
others usually does nor work very well.  While the integrity is 
required, suffering, feeling bullied and offended is optional.

As far as tango goes, it really works well to become more Argentine 
than the Argentines are. :)

Best,

Nina

Just for the record I have no problem with the flamming or what ever you want to call a heated discussion on a message list. 
It was what the internet was created for in my opinion.

Also I am totally against moderation.

I share a desk with our Marketing guys and really do enjoy reading snippets of the weekly threads out aloud over coffee. 
I just am intrigued if any of this passion actually gets translated onto the dance floor? 

Maybe we should all plan Tango-L milonga...

Message-ID: <540603.50757.qm@web36804.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear friends from tango list
I will like to comment about a new series of tango music that has been issued this days by sony-bmg in Argentina
The series are called "La resistencia del Tango  (1960-1970)" ,and include recordings made on those years by Quinteto Real from Salgan, Enrique Mario Francini sextet, Baffa &  Berlingieri , Leopoldo Federico , Sexteto Tango with Jorge Maciel,. There are more CDs, but this mentioned are the one I bought and listen to.

They are excellent. Masterizing of the original analogic records, without any doctoring of the sound , has made a rara avis of this collection. On those years, tango entered in Argentina into a dark cone , due to many reasons, rock music , syndicate of musics, and some latin music records that intend to copycat popular schemes of "west side story" kids from the usa , without an outcome that it is still not clear ( The so called "Club del Clan" where everybody danced and sing , with underrate performances )

The cds are presented as "little long plays" as they were published originally, i.e. into a carton cd size with the inner depliant that used to come with the longplays those years.


Without knowing, this musicians were working for the future, making their best to survive in a shrinking music world for tango in Argentina. Orchestras have to be replaced by sextets, or quintets, or close. 

Music houses were not interested into tango music , and in some cases, original catalog recordings were destroyed ( as was the case of a Mejia manager into RCA Victor, the creator of this "Club del clan" gang ).


But there is also a person that has to be mentioned, Aquiles Giacometti, a new manager that came into RCA Victor and made strong efforts to record again what can be saved from the wreckage, namely, Piazzolla , also D Arienzo ( which was part of a personal compromise of this manager , since there was intense pressure to record a long play with one of the members of the club del clan, but the man hold the pressure and have D Arienzo recording ). 

Technology on those years introduced stereo recording for the first time ever, so this CDs are doctored with estereo sound, an extra gift,.

The price is really a bargain , around usd 7 each one.


May you enjoy this music from "the dark years " :) I am really happy with my "little long plays " format 


alberto

p.s. Zivals is presenting this collection complete, as his "new of the month" release ,at  http://www.tangostore.com/home.php?lang=e

p.s.1. not all the CDs are as good as this I mentioned, the ones of Floreal Ruiz and Roberto Rufino .... are from their late years, better stay with their recordings with troilo and di sarli ....

Subject: [Tango-L] Should the dance style (not the social) be referred to as
	"Milonga" or" Argentine Milonga"?
Message-ID: <memo.20070719163542.2952D@john.walton4@btinternet.com.btinternet.com>

My DanceWeb site supports many different dance style, and although It
initially had a UK audience, it is now slowly being expanded to cover
more countries (starting with USA/Canada).
 
The site already recognises styles of "Tango (Argentine)" and "Tango
(Ballroom)". Partly as a result of our BBC TV programme "Strictly Come
Dancing", the style of "Milonga" is now being taught as well, and I have
been requested to support this style. 

My question is:

Can I refer to this style as simply "Milonga" or is it necessary to refer
to it as "Argentine Milonga" (or even "Tango (Milonga)"? This is
important both for organisations who enter dance classes, and dancers who
search or browse for classes. I note that Wikipedia just uses the word
Milonga for the music and the related dance form.   

(Just to confuse matters, I already use the word Milonga to refer to any
Argentine Tango Social event, a practice very common in the UK).

If one is referring to the tango danced in the milongas of Buenos Aires, no
adjective 'Argentine' is required, because tango is inherently an Argentine
dance and absence of a modifier implies it is not ballroom, Finnish, or some
other dance that has adopted the name 'tango'. In fact, my own experience in
visiting websites is that, more likely than not, when the adjective
'Argentine' is used before 'tango', it usually refers to a form of tango
danced for exhibition in Buenos Aires, not the social style. However, it is
also only fair to state that exhibition tango is the predominant form of
tango danced socially at milongas in the US.

The same applies for 'milonga'. Just call it 'Milonga', just as tango should
be referred to as 'Tango'. Save the modifiers for the non-Argentine
derivative dances.

Don't use 'Tango (Milonga)', because this has a specific meaning, applied to
early tangos that have some musical characteristics of milonga. I defer to
my colleagues who are musicians knowledgeable in this area to describe what
characterizes 'Tango Milonga'.

Nina,

I completely agree with you.   I was going to reply to
Carol's postings but
you put it better than I could.  Thank you for saying
what you did.

By the way Carol.... I truly enjoyed Nina's posting
although not agreeing
with most of it.  I can honestly say that I would
enjoy meeting her
face-to-face. :)

Nina is also right that these perceptions (that we are
discussing here) are
a matter of cultural difference (and definitely
gender).

Cheers,

Carol, Mash and everyone,

Perhaps some of you have not been on this list very
long.  This list 
has not seen a single flame in YEARS.  There is a
little poking and 
teasing, but no flaming. Criticism or disagreement is
not 
flaming.  If you want to read real flaming on this
list, then go back 
to the archives of 1997 or so.

This list is gentle and polite by comparison to what
it used to be. 
Not only did it have real flames, but there was a much
worse kind of 
flaming - in private e-mails.  That is why should this
list ever see 
any flaming in the future, I encourage people to let
others know that 
if they welcome their flames, they all have to be in
the public forum 
and not via private communication.

On another note, if you think that you can be bullied
on Internet, 
then how do you survive in your real life?  Does
whining and 
complaining about the behavior of others without
naming them gets you 
the results that you want?

Carols points demonstrate clearly a difference between
direct 
aggression and passive aggression.  On this list, it
appears that 
people accused of flaming are being directly
aggressive towards other 
people and/or their ideas.  Passive aggression is
expressed by others 
as hints and abstract ideas without ever naming
anyone, but implying 
their identity.  I believe that this difference is
cultural.  Even 
though both forms of aggression exist in all cultures,
some cultures 
prefer the direct approach while others avoid direct
confrontation 
without giving up their own aggression.

To me passive aggression is cowardly, so I probably
would be more 
direct if flame wars ever returned to this list.  It
is an issue of 
integrity - if I am willing to put my ideas forward,
then I have to 
accept the risk that they will be unpopular.  I
believe that other 
people have a right to express their disagreement with
my ideas 
however it feels right to them, as long as it is
legal.  My 
responsibility is to choose my own response.  Trying
to control 
others usually does nor work very well.  While the
integrity is 
required, suffering, feeling bullied and offended is
optional.

As far as tango goes, it really works well to become
more Argentine 
than the Argentines are. :)

Best,

Nina

Flamenco Purists Bemoan Blending of Dance Styles


Wall Street Journal
July 18, 2007  6:26pm

Flamenco is gaining in popularity around the world, but as the 
centuries-old dance form gains new fans, some adherents to tradition 
worry that quality is taking a hit. The tug-of-war between flamenco 
purists and innovators is similar to conflicts that have dogged other 
forms of art through the ages. In flamenco?s case, reports Graham Keeley 
of Britain?s Independent, the fight is complicated by questions over the 
dance?s origins, and disputes over who deserves credit for which 
innovations.

Flamenco first appeared as an entertainment among gypsies in Spain 
around 1760, deriving its flamboyant dance moves and narrative songs 
from Indian, Latin American and Arabic roots. Dancers and musician 
drawing on flamenco can sell out large spaces in Japan and the United 
Kingdom.

The flamenco singer Jos? de la Tomasa has criticized flamenco?s 
world-famous stars such as Joaqu?n Cort?s for sacrificing the art?s 
roots by adding in moves from other dance styles. To traditionalists, 
Introducing ballet or jazz steps into flamenco is viewed as merely a 
marketing ploy. ?In Andalusia, we don?t give flamenco the importance it 
deserves, not just as a first-rate cultural asset but as a potential 
source of revenue. But I don?t think we should let ourselves be guided 
by purely monetary considerations,? says Rafael Infante, an adviser to 
the Seville Flamenco Biennale.

Flamenco modernizers claim they are enriching the form rather than 
destroying it. Tina Panadero, director of the Flamenco Museum in Seville 
and the niece of a well-known flamenco innovator, says the dispute is 
ironic, given the dance?s multicultural heritage. ?What people don?t 
realize is that there is no definition of flamenco. It has only been 
around for about 150 years, and is always changing.? ? Robin Moroney

Subject: [Tango-L] Masculine Tango TV Commercial
Message-ID: <26D71FA5-F6AB-4AC4-AE5A-FE28B822E639@tango.org>

Women have a different learning process than men.

They also have a different fantasy about dancing than the men.  
Frequently women like the idea of performing, whereas most men are  
truly terrified of it. So, I think tango or even dance in general is  
marketed wrong, starting with the TV shows like "Dancing with the  
Stars", which presents a FEMININE appeal, not a masculine appeal.

The feminine dance fantasy is to be swept of her feet by a dashing  
and skillful leader. Maybe she is nervous or terrified, but he is so  
competent that he takes care of the movement and the dancing. One  
could argue that women can learn without going to beginner  
classes.... except for other issues like, who are they going to dance  
with, and the fact that the women also have to make the dance work.  
In fact, I notice a lot of women quit group classes at the  
intermediate level, preferring to learn from competent or semi- 
competent guys at the milongas.

Retention of the men means,
  (1) First dance class experience is a success.
  (2) First 6-week series is a success.
  (3) Entry into the community (dances) is a success

(I once had a wife tell me her husband was forced to walk backwards  
with another guy for the whole first hour of tango class. I probably  
don't have to tell you that he never went back.)



PSYCHOLOGY and MOTIVATION.

So, what would a masculine TV Commercial look like? What does the  
beginner guy imagine as he stumbles into his first tango class?

Most men come to tango with the goal of impressing the ladies and  
feeling so competent and confident that when an attractive woman is  
standing in front of them, he will know what to do. For normal,  
beginner guys this is a daunting and challenging experience; giving  
the men the "gift of feeling successful" is extremely confidence  
building. it is a kind of "power", not in the power-over, but in the  
power-capability sense.


MASCULINE TANGO TV COMMERCIAL

Let's imagine casting a tango TV commercial to appeal to the NON- 
DANCING MAN'S FANTASIES. I wouldn't fill it with ganchos and boleos.  
I certainly wouldn't put him under the lights on stage with all these  
people watching. Imagine an intimate, cafe with couples sitting  
comfortably at tables, and a few dozen couples on the floor. (Let's  
call it a typical Milonga in Denver). They are wearing casual party  
clothes, not a suit or tuxedo (that would get back to the feminine  
fantasy).

I'd focus in on the face of one couple, with the woman smiling  
admiringly at the man, perhaps laughing at some witticism. Music  
starts, he smiles confidently, takes her into his arms and glides  
effortlessly around the room with her. Maybe he throws in a couple  
cool moves (camera on the feet doing a couple ochos), and she smiles  
again. See how this is ANTI Dancing with the Stars, which is all  
about flashy, fast moves, being on stage, and athletic, dramatic  
movements?


MATCH BEGINNER CLASS TO THE MASCULINE DANCE FANTASY

The key psychological elements for the men are confidence,  
competence, ease, admiring lady, movement through space, "knowing  
what to do". (Yes, 4 of 6 are pretty much identical)

That is the experience I try to give beginner guys, and why I don't  
use long sequences.
  - Start with his ability to walk. (Movement)
  - Give him three or four short sequences. ("Steps", aka "what to do")
  - Show how they can be swapped back and forth (improvisation)
  - Show how they can take him around the room (Navigation)
  - Show how they fit the rhythm and phrasing of the music. (Feels  
right)

The last point about musicality is my other key idea, which is  
wrecked as soon as you try to use longer sequences.

Moving effortlessly feels right IF AND ONLY IF the movements (short  
sequences) correspond to the musical phrasing, meaning movement is  
initiated on the strong beat, and movement resolution matches musical  
resolution. It is like breathing or singing, you have to have commas

Subject: [Tango-L] Should the dance style (not the social) be referred
 to as"Milonga" or" Argentine Milonga"?
Message-ID: <BAY105-F3461BB1FCF030C0910DB7397FB0@phx.gbl>



Dear John,

Argentina has three ballroom dances:

1-Tango
2-Milonga
3- Argentine Vals

They are three distinct dances . They should not be called styles.

Tango has different styles:  Salon, Milonguero, Nuevo, Canyengue, Liso, 
Orillero, etc.

There is also Finnish Tango, American Tango, European Tango.

There are two styles of milonga:

The Milonga Campera or Surea (the original) and the city milonga
(the one we normally dance nowadays).
Other words could be used in reference to milonga such as Milonga Candombera 
. (the meaning of this is  that it may have something of Candombe rhythm).

A milonga is a place where tango, milonga and vals are danced as well.

Vals is sometimes called "Vals Cruzado".  A reference to the fact that the 
woman locks her feet in front at certain moments.

Summary:  We should refer to these dances as:
Tango - Milonga - Vals

Best regards, Sergio

Subject: [Tango-L]  Dance Flaming: not an isolated phenomenon
Message-ID: <7.0.1.0.0.20070719114432.01ae7808@earthnet.net>

Thank you, Carol!

This is really beautiful.  I am glad that have 
the time these couple of days to hang out on the 
list here and read everything.  Usually I don't 
have such luxury.  So I am writing a huge post, 
hopefully not too difficult to read.

Some flamenco purists, as well as tango purists, 
love making other tango and flamenco purists hate 
them. The criticism usually comes from the people who cannot do the same work.

This is not flaming.  This criticism and 
different perception is much needed.  It is not 
one way or another.  It is both.  It is a part of 
the bigger whole.  It is a much needed 
scrutiny.  These things must be voiced and this 
article has done it very well.  It is all about 
awareness.  This is NOT flaming.

Maybe the idea of flaming is not well understood anymore.

About the dances, the trick for this fusion is to 
stay pure, and these flamenco dancers manage to 
do it beautifully!  It is very, very difficult to 
tell the new story while keeping the dance in its 
pure form.  But it is not impossible.  If you can 
see some of these videos, they are 
incredible.  Even if you do not know much about 
flamenco, you will understand what this is.

Amaury discovered our web site slightly 
prematurely and I was not prepared to talk about 
TangOl? Compa??a de Danza. The web site is not 
completely done, has some errors, and we are 
still working on it.  But I might as well talk a 
little about it now and about the fusion of AT 
and flamenco that we are working with right now.

First, we are Argentine tango dancers (Gregory 
and I).  Natalia and Mark are flamenco dancers, 
musicians and singers.  Neither I nor Gregory 
will even become flamenco dancers like Natalia, 
and Natalia may never become a tango dancer (but 
I have hopes).  We are very conscious and careful 
about protecting the authenticity of our own 
dance forms.  This is very important.  When 
artists create on the edge of reason (according 
to others), they are risking being perceived as 
traitors.  That is traitors to what they had put 
forward as their identity.  The public feels 
deceived.  But the real thing is that artists, 
and particularly dancers, have such a fierce 
loyalty to their dance that it is unchangeable 
because they become who they are through the art 
of their dance.  They are INSEPARABLE.  One dies 
without the other.  The love and the passion 
always remains with the original dance form.  It is at the cellular level.

Second, no fusion ever works as a social dance 
form.  NONE.  The fusion is for art and 
performance only.  It is very important to keep 
this distinction in mind. What Joaqu?n Cort?s 
does most other flamenco dancers cannot do and 
would not want to do.  This needs to be seen and 
absorbed and, most of all, enjoyed.  it is meant to move people.

What I have discovered is that when the two 
different dance forms are fused, the people who 
are doing the work need to have expertise in one 
form and have other people working with them who 
are experts in the other dance form.  This is 
essential.  People who dance only one form and 
then fuse it with something they may know a 
little bit, usually do not succeed and risk 
destroying the authenticity and the expressive value of their work.

There is a big difference in dancing between 
flamenco and tango. Flamenco remained a living 
dance, where its meaning (not its form) has been 
changing with the times.  The complexity of 
compass remained the same.  Flamenco begins with 
the singer, who is followed by the dancer.  The 
musicians follow the dancer and his or her change 
in compass.  It is very, very complicated and 
difficult.  In flamenco, women now incorporate 
movements that were originally danced by the 
men.  It is very exciting because the purists are 
able to recognize the artistry that it requires and the expression.

Flamenco is very complicated.  It is not a social 
dance, and yet it is.  It is danced when a group 
of people gets together.  And it evolves and 
changes then.  But it is not the same way a 
social dance as tango is.  So for any fusion, in 
terms of tango, there needs to be a clear 
understanding that the fusion is not to be danced socially.

In tango, nothing new that in any way would 
resemble the changes in flamenco has happened in 
years, more accurately, since the music 
Piazzolla.  Tango followed a different 
history.  Because tango follows the music and not 
the dancer or singer, it changes with the music, when the music changes.

Joaqu?n Cort?s is such an amazing flamenco dancer 
that anything that he does is justified by his 
phenomenal mastery of the pure, authentic form of 
the dance.  Has anyone ever seen him 
dance?  There are videos on www.youtube.com.

The only comparison that I can make in tango is 
Pablo Pugliese fusing tango and modern 
dance.  Pablo is a master of Argentine 
tango.  What he does with the fusion is 
gorgeous.  And there is no corruption of the 
tango because no one else can do what he is 
doing.  But Pablo does not teach the fusion and does not dance it socially.

In the last several decades, on the outskirts of 
the cities in Spain, flamenco has been 
changing.  The gypsies and others have been 
singing about things that are current, such as 
AIDS and drugs.  It is as if flamenco tells the 
current story of the people and the singers, 
musicians and dancers are the story tellers.

Tango does not tell new stories.  The new tangos 
are rarely composed.  There are no new tango 
lyrics, at least none that I know of.  The 
closest lyrics that come to tango are the lyrics 
of Rock Nacional in Argentina.  They are 
beautiful and they tell the current stories, such 
as the songs of Silvina Carre.

I feel a bit envious of the flamenco dancers for 
having many, many videos of their great dancers, 
going back decades.  We have nothing like that in 
tango.  We have some, but it is so very little by 
comparison to the huge quantity of flamenco video 
recordings.  And not only of the dancers and musicians, but also the singers.

Sometimes I wish that the musicians and song 
writers of the Rock Nacional genre would join 
tango, but that probably is impossible, since one 
maybe a direct opposing response to the other.

Again, thank you Carol for posting a great news story!

Warmest regards to all,

Nina

Considering rhythm as the basis of improvisation and actually dancing with 
rhythm are two wildly different things ;-) ;-) As for skill and quality of 
tango dancing, I think Atlanta has as good as there is. Steve, please 
consider coming to Atlanta next week. You and Susan can enjoy 5 milongas in 
4 nights with the Atlanta dancers (and the best from other places as well). 
Plus you get to see a performance by Gustavo Naveira & Giselle Anne. I think 
you might be surprised. Talk is cheap, come on down and dance the dance. :-)

With best regards,

Manuel

Manuel (and Everyone Else):

Thank you for the invitation.  Unfortunately, DJ duties in Dallas and the 
job that pays my bills will keep me from accepting at this time.  Of 
course, we were both at the Miami tango festival a few years ago, so we 
are at least familiar with each others' dancing if not each others' 
teaching.

I didn't mean to make it seem as though I consider rhythm as the basis of 
improvisation.  To clarify, I meant that those of us in the tango 
community seem to hold two views about tango.  Rhythm and the music are 
the basis of the dance.  Improvisation is an important aspect of dancing 
tango.  Why is it then that so many instructors teach in such a way that 
they all but ignore the rhythm and treat improvisation as an advanced 
topic?

If we adopt an approach to teaching, so that (1) the first dance class 
experience is a success; (2) the first 6-week series is a success. and (3) 
the entry into the community (dances) is a success, we can better launch 
beginners into the tango community.  I think this can be achieved by 
emphasizing rhythmic movement to small elements of the dance and 
improvisation in the first 6-8 weeks of classes.

(Hopefully, most people on Tango-L are enjoying our exchange and aren't 
judging both of us a trolls.)

With best regards,
Steve

Tom,
 
     Wonderful script for your male-directed tango commercial. Sounds like it might work very well for building the always-lacking leader roster in most tango communities. When can we expect you to have it in the can and ready to distribute? Seriously, tango communities across the world struggle to attract and retain men, and you will be doing the tango world a great service to direct and produce such a film. Please do it!

 You're right, Tom!

I would say that the best commercial ever for an American guy to learn tango was Al Pacino dancing in Scent of a Woman--it's all you describe.

Plus I know several guys who began lessons after seeing that film.

Best,
Cherie

Women have a different learning process than men.

They also have a different fantasy about dancing than the men.  
Frequently women like the idea of performing, whereas most men are  
truly terrified of it. So, I think tango or even dance in general is  
marketed wrong, starting with the TV shows like "Dancing with the  
Stars", which presents a FEMININE appeal, not a masculine appeal.

The feminine dance fantasy is to be swept of her feet by a dashing  
and skillful leader. Maybe she is nervous or terrified, but he is so  
competent that he takes care of the movement and the dancing. One  
could argue that women can learn without going to beginner  
classes.... except for other issues like, who are they going to dance  
with, and the fact that the women also have to make the dance work.  
In fact, I notice a lot of women quit group classes at the  
intermediate level, preferring to learn from competent or semi- 
competent guys at the milongas.

Retention of the men means,
  (1) First dance class experience is a success.
  (2) First 6-week series is a success.
  (3) Entry into the community (dances) is a success

(I once had a wife tell me her husband was forced to walk backwards  
with another guy for the whole first hour of tango class. I probably  
don't have to tell you that he never went back.)



PSYCHOLOGY and MOTIVATION.

So, what would a masculine TV Commercial look like? What does the  
beginner guy imagine as he stumbles into his first tango class?

Most men come to tango with the goal of impressing the ladies and  
feeling so competent and confident that when an attractive woman is  
standing in front of them, he will know what to do. For normal,  
beginner guys this is a daunting and challenging experience; giving  
the men the "gift of feeling successful" is extremely confidence  
building. it is a kind of "power", not in the power-over, but in the  
power-capability sense.


MASCULINE TANGO TV COMMERCIAL

Let's imagine casting a tango TV commercial to appeal to the NON- 
DANCING MAN'S FANTASIES. I wouldn't fill it with ganchos and boleos.  
I certainly wouldn't put him under the lights on stage with all these  
people watching. Imagine an intimate, cafe with couples sitting  
comfortably at tables, and a few dozen couples on the floor. (Let's  
call it a typical Milonga in Denver). They are wearing casual party  
clothes, not a suit or tuxedo (that would get back to the feminine  
fantasy).

I'd focus in on the face of one couple, with the woman smiling  
admiringly at the man, perhaps laughing at some witticism. Music  
starts, he smiles confidently, takes her into his arms and glides  
effortlessly around the room with her. Maybe he throws in a couple  
cool moves (camera on the feet doing a couple ochos), and she smiles  
again. See how this is ANTI Dancing with the Stars, which is all  
about flashy, fast moves, being on stage, and athletic, dramatic  
movements?


MATCH BEGINNER CLASS TO THE MASCULINE DANCE FANTASY

The key psychological elements for the men are confidence,  
competence, ease, admiring lady, movement through space, "knowing  
what to do". (Yes, 4 of 6 are pretty much identical)

That is the experience I try to give beginner guys, and why I don't  
use long sequences.
  - Start with his ability to walk. (Movement)
  - Give him three or four short sequences. ("Steps", aka "what to do")
  - Show how they can be swapped back and forth (improvisation)
  - Show how they can take him around the room (Navigation)
  - Show how they fit the rhythm and phrasing of the music. (Feels  
right)

The last point about musicality is my other key idea, which is  
wrecked as soon as you try to use longer sequences.

Moving effortlessly feels right IF AND ONLY IF the movements (short  
sequences) correspond to the musical phrasing, meaning movement is  
initiated on the strong beat, and movement resolution matches musical  
resolution. It is like breathing or singing, you have to have commas  
and periods in your movement, or you get  
onelongunendingmushofasentencewithnocommasorperieodsorplacestobreathe.

"Flamenco modernizers claim they are enriching the form rather than

It's all about trying to justify one's quest for profit by stealing
legitimacy for what you do by calling it something it isn't.

-Kinda like musicians seeking money from tourists are 'enriching' tango by
adding a simple drum beat to sampled pieces of authentic tango.

-Kinda like aboriginals sitting in Sydney harbor are 'enriching' their
culture by playing their didgeridoos to a simple drum beat.

-Kinda like Peruvian musicians in Europe and the US are 'enriching' their
musical heritage by playing their reed flutes to a simple drum beat.

Both musicians and dancers seek to maximise their income. The easiest way to
do that is to cater to the general audience, -those who are not yet
initiated in the culture. They are easy pickin's. By serving them some
Flamenco Lite or McTango, the consumer sees something they recognise and is
more willing to purchase the product.

The 'artist' will always claim to be 'taking it further' although they know
better than anyone else that they are lying. If someone wanted to create
something new, then why do they see a need to use an already established
name like Flamenco or Tango? You have a new dance or a new music, why not a
new name?

Thank you, Carol!

This is really beautiful.  I am glad that have 
the time these couple of days to hang out on the 
list here and read everything.  Usually I don't 
have such luxury.  So I am writing a huge post, 
hopefully not too difficult to read.

Some flamenco purists, as well as tango purists, 
love making other tango and flamenco purists hate 
them. The criticism usually comes from the people who cannot do the same work.

This is not flaming.  This criticism and 
different perception is much needed.  It is not 
one way or another.  It is both.  It is a part of 
the bigger whole.  It is a much needed 
scrutiny.  These things must be voiced and this 
article has done it very well.  It is all about 
awareness.  This is NOT flaming.

Maybe the idea of flaming is not well understood anymore.

About the dances, the trick for this fusion is to 
stay pure, and these flamenco dancers manage to 
do it beautifully!  It is very, very difficult to 
tell the new story while keeping the dance in its 
pure form.  But it is not impossible.  If you can 
see some of these videos, they are 
incredible.  Even if you do not know much about 
flamenco, you will understand what this is.

Amaury discovered our web site slightly 
prematurely and I was not prepared to talk about 
TangOl? Compa??a de Danza. The web site is not 
completely done, has some errors, and we are 
still working on it.  But I might as well talk a 
little about it now and about the fusion of AT 
and flamenco that we are working with right now.

First, we are Argentine tango dancers (Gregory 
and I).  Natalia and Mark are flamenco dancers, 
musicians and singers.  Neither I nor Gregory 
will even become flamenco dancers like Natalia, 
and Natalia may never become a tango dancer (but 
I have hopes).  We are very conscious and careful 
about protecting the authenticity of our own 
dance forms.  This is very important.  When 
artists create on the edge of reason (according 
to others), they are risking being perceived as 
traitors.  That is traitors to what they had put 
forward as their identity.  The public feels 
deceived.  But the real thing is that artists, 
and particularly dancers, have such a fierce 
loyalty to their dance that it is unchangeable 
because they become who they are through the art 
of their dance.  They are INSEPARABLE.  One dies 
without the other.  The love and the passion 
always remains with the original dance form.  It is at the cellular level.

Second, no fusion ever works as a social dance 
form.  NONE.  The fusion is for art and 
performance only.  It is very important to keep 
this distinction in mind. What Joaqu?n Cort?s 
does most other flamenco dancers cannot do and 
would not want to do.  This needs to be seen and 
absorbed and, most of all, enjoyed.  it is meant to move people.

What I have discovered is that when the two 
different dance forms are fused, the people who 
are doing the work need to have expertise in one 
form and have other people working with them who 
are experts in the other dance form.  This is 
essential.  People who dance only one form and 
then fuse it with something they may know a 
little bit, usually do not succeed and risk 
destroying the authenticity and the expressive value of their work.

There is a big difference in dancing between 
flamenco and tango. Flamenco remained a living 
dance, where its meaning (not its form) has been 
changing with the times.  The complexity of 
compass remained the same.  Flamenco begins with 
the singer, who is followed by the dancer.  The 
musicians follow the dancer and his or her change 
in compass.  It is very, very complicated and 
difficult.  In flamenco, women now incorporate 
movements that were originally danced by the 
men.  It is very exciting because the purists are 
able to recognize the artistry that it requires and the expression.

Flamenco is very complicated.  It is not a social 
dance, and yet it is.  It is danced when a group 
of people gets together.  And it evolves and 
changes then.  But it is not the same way a 
social dance as tango is.  So for any fusion, in 
terms of tango, there needs to be a clear 
understanding that the fusion is not to be danced socially.

In tango, nothing new that in any way would 
resemble the changes in flamenco has happened in 
years, more accurately, since the music 
Piazzolla.  Tango followed a different 
history.  Because tango follows the music and not 
the dancer or singer, it changes with the music, when the music changes.

Joaqu?n Cort?s is such an amazing flamenco dancer 
that anything that he does is justified by his 
phenomenal mastery of the pure, authentic form of 
the dance.  Has anyone ever seen him 
dance?  There are videos on www.youtube.com.

The only comparison that I can make in tango is 
Pablo Pugliese fusing tango and modern 
dance.  Pablo is a master of Argentine 
tango.  What he does with the fusion is 
gorgeous.  And there is no corruption of the 
tango because no one else can do what he is 
doing.  But Pablo does not teach the fusion and does not dance it socially.

In the last several decades, on the outskirts of 
the cities in Spain, flamenco has been 
changing.  The gypsies and others have been 
singing about things that are current, such as 
AIDS and drugs.  It is as if flamenco tells the 
current story of the people and the singers, 
musicians and dancers are the story tellers.

Tango does not tell new stories.  The new tangos 
are rarely composed.  There are no new tango 
lyrics, at least none that I know of.  The 
closest lyrics that come to tango are the lyrics 
of Rock Nacional in Argentina.  They are 
beautiful and they tell the current stories, such 
as the songs of Silvina Carre.

I feel a bit envious of the flamenco dancers for 
having many, many videos of their great dancers, 
going back decades.  We have nothing like that in 
tango.  We have some, but it is so very little by 
comparison to the huge quantity of flamenco video 
recordings.  And not only of the dancers and musicians, but also the singers.

Sometimes I wish that the musicians and song 
writers of the Rock Nacional genre would join 
tango, but that probably is impossible, since one 
maybe a direct opposing response to the other.

Again, thank you Carol for posting a great news story!

Warmest regards to all,

Nina

Subject: [Tango-L] Flaming women at classes
Message-ID: <010b01c7ca2a$1160c420$34224c60$@com>

Thank you for the great letter, Tom !

Absolutely, TV shows like "Dancing with the Stars" is an anti commercial for
most men.

I have a problem now which might be similar.

My women, with whom I regularly dance after the classes started to compare
me with their husbands ( it happens between couples only, of course ) this
way: " It is so good to dance with Igor, but you are so clumsy, can not do
this or that...". And guys feel bad about themselves.

What to do? How to discourage women from criticizing? Of course, they
progress much faster than men.
When I dance with them - they really become better, all men are noticing
that. But that puts them into the distracting position of inflaming
critique.

I do not know what to do. The difference between level of dancers is usually
quite large in my classes and many people insist on not changing partners.
That in some way contributes to the problem.

I'd appreciate advice.

Igor Polk 







PS
I have to admit, I think TV shows like "Dancing with the Stars" works for
men who already feel that they are good dancers - they do not feel unable to
do this - they like the sexy partners and atmosphere.

Subject: [Tango-L] Should the dance style (not the social) be referred
	to as "Milonga" or" Argentine Milonga"?
Message-ID: <78785.88543.qm@web30306.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

When I dance milonga at the country western place, I tell the women that
  we are going to do one step.
  If they are into dance, I may later explain that it is really tango milonga.
  When I dance milonga at an Argentine Tango milonga, I refer to it
  simply as milonga.
   
  Know your audience, but don't be too reluctant to educate them.
  (Some of us like to learn new things.)
   
  Regarding the multiple meanings of "milonga"...
  Hopefully, you can expect that the people you will be dealing with can 
  grasp the concept that a word can have more than one meaning.
  I'd like to believe that learning new things actually appeals to a certain
  segment of the population.
   
  This is just me, but I would not refer to milonga as a "style".
   
  Regarding Wikipedia... always check other sources. Some stuff is good. 
  Some stuff is less than good.
   
   
   
  original post 
   
  My DanceWeb site supports many different dance style, and although It
initially had a UK audience, it is now slowly being expanded to cover
more countries (starting with USA/Canada).

The site already recognises styles of "Tango (Argentine)" and "Tango
(Ballroom)". Partly as a result of our BBC TV programme "Strictly Come
Dancing", the style of "Milonga" is now being taught as well, and I
have
been requested to support this style. 

My question is:

Can I refer to this style as simply "Milonga" or is it necessary to
refer
to it as "Argentine Milonga" (or even "Tango (Milonga)"? This is
important both for organisations who enter dance classes, and dancers
who
search or browse for classes. I note that Wikipedia just uses the word
Milonga for the music and the related dance form.   

(Just to confuse matters, I already use the word Milonga to refer to
any
Argentine Tango Social event, a practice very common in the UK).

Google this.
  "The St. Louis Blues tango"
  One of the first hits will be a link to an NPR sound clip.
   
  I seemed to remember that WC Handy included a tango 
  section in the first published blues composition in the US. 
  That was 1914.
  Guess I didn't dream it.
   
  We've "talked" about the hugely popular "Blue Tango" from 
  about 1950.
  How about "TeenAge Tango" recorded by some of the guys
  from Bill Haley's Comets?
   
  OK. Not exactly early 20th century, but, I just had to share.

  Nina,
Tango was the most popular dance in Europe from 1920 till 1950 and longer.
my uncle danced tango every weekend in 1950-1955 at parties at their house.
I know a woman who remembered dancing tango in Paris in 1944-1946. I knew a
man who danced tango in Ireland in 1920s 5 days a week !

I know that there was a lot of records of German, French, Polish, Russian
orchestras with good tangos. It seems to me Argentinean records got their
way to the European dance parties either. I have no idea that some of the
musicians were from Argentina. Probably not after 1930. Before - yes - even
Canaro was in Paris, right?

Where are those records
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just a handful remained.

Does anyone know about video of tango dance of the period 1910-1930
????????? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes, it seems to me the music was slightly different ( reminding of salon
Argentine Tangos of 1920s period ) and the dancing was probably different
either. But only videos could tell more about it. 

How about America? Armstrong introduced a little of Tango in one of his
earlier pieces. He wouldn't do it if it would be popular at some period
there.

Does anyone knows about other american tango records?

Neil,

I disagree. :)

The musicians that you describe do what you 
describe.  But the motivations that you ascribe to them are incorrect.

There is no way, and I mean NO WAY that one can 
reasonably put in the same comparison Joaqu?n 
Cort?s and the street musicians.  Joaqu?n Cort?s 
is a dancer of incredible talent, beauty and 
understanding of the dance.  This is someone 
incredibly accomplished.  Joaqu?n Cort?s does not 
need to do anything to have more money.  This 
dancer has been celebrated all over the world for years.

The closest comparison would be to say that when 
Michail Baryshnikov danced his heartbeat (which I 
was lucky to see in Teatro Colon), he was trying 
to do it for profit.  There is no logic to this.

Perhaps the definition of art is what is not 
clear.  Art means different things to different 
people.  To me, an artist, any artist, never 
cares what others think.  Joaqu?n Cort?s is such 
an artist and so is Baryshnikov.  To be an 
artist, to me means to push ones self beyond 
one's own known abilities. That is transformative 
work.  It is demanding, and the results have no guarantees.

But, art is more than that.  The people that you 
described, such as the Peruvian musicians, are 
doing something else, no less meaningful.  Music 
belongs to humanity.  They make music the way 
they can.  I have seen Andinos play in NY.  And 
they ask for money from people who like what they 
do.  Those who do not like, do not have to pay.

Personally, I am grateful to these people because 
with their effort they are often much more 
accessible than the artists whose work is seen only by the elite.

When I was very young and unsophisticated, I was 
in NY, hanging around the subway stations for the 
pure joy of public transportation.  This was the 
place where I heard for the first time 
Andinos.  I knew that their music may not have 
been good from the purist's perspective.  But to 
me they were incredible.  It was the 
feeling.  They LOVED their music.  I still have 
the tape that I bought from them.  I later 
discovered many wonderful things from that 
genre.  For this reason, I never begrudge any money to the street musicians.

And in regard to tango, the people who dance in 
the streets of BsAs also bring something of 
value.  Anyone who is doing something is bringing 
something of value.  For example, there is a 
woman in San Telmo on Dorrego who dances 
alone.  She is dressed in trashy outfits and, if 
I were to guess, is sometimes intoxicated (gosh, 
I hope that she is not a mother of someone on 
this list!).  She has been there for years.  If 
she were gone tomorrow, and I was walking and not 
seeing her, I would miss her.  She tried to do 
something with tango.  There was something.

OK, I am exaggerating.  This is what happens when 
I am left alone for hours in front of my computer.

But my point is that art is difficult to 
define.  I once had a vicious food fight in a 
restaurant in Santa Fe, NM because one woman was 
claiming a cut and dry definition of art and I 
insisted that even a Hallmark card can be art to someone.

I can only speak from my own experience and my 
view of tango as an art form.  On a social level, 
it is not art.  If you try to dance art socially, 
either its soul or yours will die.

An artist cannot be owing anything to other 
people, such as a social dance partner.  An 
artist belongs to his or her art.  This is the 
beauty of tango.  One and the same person can 
pursue it both socially and as an art form.

I hope that I get rescued from my computer soon.

My warmest regards to everyone,

Nina

Dear Sergio,

I will try to get back to some of this when time permits. I am
familiar with these proxy arguments involving excerpts of indecent
lyrics and such, but uncomfortable with the large amount of
extrapolation and logical leaps required to get from A to B. It will
be nice to come up with a list of supposed primary sources, too, and
then examine those.

By the way, and without discussing anything seriously before I can get
to my materials,
just as an observation, I have never quite understood the logic of how
the existence of indecent lyrics (attached or not to tango music)
logically necessitates brothel/prostitution origin of tango
music/dancing.

At most it may indicate the mindset or world view (and this is really
pushing it) of the author, or 'poet'. I think practically every
culture has had indecent texts floating around, sometimes attached
post factum to decent songs, sometimes attached to previously songless
melodies, sometimes just being 'dirty' poems without music (not to
mention larger literary works). Are we going to claim they (or, even
more expansively, related art forms) must have had a brothel origin?
That has never made much logical sense to me, but then I have not
really thought too deeply about it, so perhaps someone else can
comment or suggest how these things connect logically.

Also, it would be nice if one would also check through Argentine folk
songs (like what the payadores would sing, for example) and other
literary works and determine if Argentina has had no indecent literary
works of any kind except in tango songs (why - because no one is
seriously claiming that folk dancing originated in brothels, for
example).

Sorry for the wordiness but there are so many questions with these
types of arguments..

With best regards,

Konstantin

After all the discussion about learning Tango in 6-months,
we now have Stephen Brown who has it down to 6-weeks, with
words like 'mastery' thrown in for good measure. What next
- 6 days, with perhaps a little less  'mastery'?

And, why is everyone suddenly sooooooo polite? We have
Manuel apologising for his poor English, when it's obvious
to anyone that he was using the words 'mastery' and
'passable' correctly and it was Stephen, presumably a
native English' speaker, who was using them incorrectly.

------------

I don't know if you are a native English speaker Keith,
although you certainly write with the idiom of a native. My
friends in HK tell me that English is becoming extinct in
the under 30 crowd. Either way, Steve's use of the term
mastery may be correctly interpreted as he intended it to
be interpreted. On the other hand Steve, Manuel's original
interpretation is also valid. I don't think it is fair to
accuse him of parsing words. In common usage, English is
often horribly ambiguous. Hence we engage in dialogue to
clarify meaning.

I've tried to make this point already about the phrase
"world class". A phrase that is both so ambiguous and so
loaded that it requires a great deal of clarification. When
Nina used the term, everybody interpreted it under the
burden of their own baggage. Many were offended.
Fortunately, Nina clarified what she meant by "world
class". If you reread her original post once you understand
her definition, there is nothing offensive about it.
(Unless you are ofended by circular reasoning.) In fact, it
might even help tango tourists understand and survive with
the natives. (Or maybe I am just too thick skinned to get
offended after 17 years of being the 6 foot Irish-looking
guy on construction sites?)

I suspect that the resistance to the idea that some
teachers can create productive members of the community in
6 months is also a matter of misinterpretation of meaning.
I stated that my students enjoy themselves on the floor,
and give an enjoyable dance to their partners without
interfering with the enjoyment of others. Steve said much
the same thing. Maybe I wasn't clear that I meant they
enjoy dancing with partners with a similar level of
experience. 

These guys can't compete with the Manuel, Ron, or Keith for
the best dancers in the room. But they usually finish each
step with all their weight on the correct foot, although
some aren't yet strong enough to maintain an axis. They
dance with more vocabulary than Ron suggests, but I'm not
likely to have taught sacadas at this level. They move
differently do DiSarli than they move to D'Arienzo,
although D'Agostino may leave them flat. They have
scratched the surface of the immense depth that Robin
implies, but it's not a very deep scratch. Most
importantly, they will not ruin Manuel's evening by
plodding along at half the pace of the ronda, nor will they
interfere with Ron's quiet enjoyment of tango by bouncing
around like charged gas molecules.

I suspect that the 6 week students in Texas have slightly
less acumen, or else they are putting in a whole lot more
than 6 hours a week. We expect our students to commit to 6
hours a week, and we lead by example as well as foster
positive peer presure to motivate them to practice and
dance outside of class.

Steve (or anyone else for that matter),

Would you be so kind as to explain what you mean by "Structure of the Dance"?  I think I understand the other three layers you listed (although I suppose I could be wrong about those), but I'm quite sure about not understanding the third layer you mentioned.

As you might guess, I'm a beginner to Tango (almost 5 months into it), but so far it's been a fun hobby to enjoy with my wife.

Thanks,

David

As I see it, there are four layers of tango learning (from the top to the 
foundation). 
 
4) Step Patterns and Choreographies 
3) Structure of the Dance 
2) Quality of Movement 
1) Rhythm - the foundation

Dear Janis,

I guess you missed the next statement referring to the
dynamics of
colonialism in South America.  It is not uncommon (in
South America) to see
colonial societies embracing the ways of the old
country as the 'proper
culture' while looking down at the native forms of
arts.  

Europeans exterminated the Araucarian Indians as well
as the African slaves
in Argentine.  South American History as was taught
during the 60's and 70's
was very clearly Euro-centric.  

There are still many parts of porteno culture that
have not overcome this
complex of inferiority towards Europe.

These are my two cents for all that is worth.
Amaury

Just look at how anxious Argentines were to mimic
Paris architecture and
urban design.


French immigrants in BsAs duplicated buildings of
Paris by using the plans
designed by French architects.  We can't blame the
Argentines, but we can
thank the French.  This is the reason that Buenos
Aires is referred to as
"the Paris of South America."  Not because there are
Hermes and Louis
Vuitton shops in BsAs.

Hi Igor,

Trini, here.  Something similar happened in the middle of a
class that Sean & I were teaching.  We had taught them some
basic move.  When we asked if there were any questions, a
young woman complained that the move didn't feel the same
with her boyfriend as it did with Sean.  Sean simply tilted
his head and said, "Well, he's only been doing it for 10
minutes.  I've been doing it for 10 years."  She (and
everyone else) got the message.

In classes, we also always talk about how better dancers
compensate for less experienced dancers as part of social
etiquette.  In particular, experienced men and less
experienced women.  That also helps the ladies realize that
it might not always be the guy's fault.

Hope this helps.

Trini de Pittsburgh

Yeah, I've noticed that the women can be pretty harsh.

As a teacher, I really try to head that off. If I hear it out of the  
corner of my ear, I go over and ask if I can help, or just intervene  
directly. I usually talk to the woman first, which indicates that  
they may have issues to work on as well, and it takes the pressure  
off the guy, so that when I give him something to work on he isn't as  
defensive.

Yes, I don't like the energy of not changing partners. I tolerate it  
in a small class, or when the couples are of vastly different ages.  
But, over time most couples will change. Frankly, the ones who never  
change never actually succeed at tango.

The best is when you get the busy executive and his wife. Maybe the  
marriage counseler said "this time do something SHE wants to do". He  
is dragged kicking and screaming to tango, where he is WAY out of his  
comfort zone.

Hello,

Carol wrote a beautiful post addressing this from a more general
perspective, and I agree with the totality of her points and would
have said similar things.

I just want to offer an even broader comment, not just about dancing.
I think it is interesting and significant that the last fifty or so
years have possibly been the first period in human history that we
have shifted on a large scale from being mostly creators to being
mostly consumers of music and other performing arts(*). We are into
uncharted territory.

Up until recorded music, radio, television and other media really
changed the way we viewed entertainment, it was a totally different
way of life with practically everyone in every family either playing
an instrument or dancing or being a storyteller or a singer, and
people created entertainment instead of consuming someone else's
creation.

Just some scattered thoughts..(**)

With best regards,

Konstantin
Victoria, Canada

(*) Yes, various disclaimers apply. The Romans were a special case of
proto-consumers with their proud inability and lack of desire to
create music (they hired others to do that). Other examples probably
exist.

(**) And dancing was indeed huge until the Great Depression or so.
I've read some estimates from papers, with astonishing figures from
the 1920s in the US, like: some 65,000 people would go out in Chicago
to dance every night of the week, or that in San Francisco there would
be more than a hundred dancing halls within a six-block radius
downtown, and that some dancing halls would regularly host up to 5,000
people at a time. I am going by memory, but can check the actual
statistics. In any case the numbers were absolutely mind-boggling.

Nina said:

" But my point is that art is difficult to 
Define...

I can only speak from my own experience and my 
view of tango as an art form.  On a social level, 
it is not art. "

Igor:

Art belongs to what you create wholeheartedly, with all your soul. In
general sense it is Creation.

Art is a specific part of Creation. Other things, which are part of the
Creation include scientific work, managerial work, and growing vegetables,
and household work, anything. They all could all be Creation. Or not. It
means they all can be done with the same level of inspiration. Or not.

Usually, Art is distinguished from them by the filed: Painting, Dancing, and
so on. What people usually consider to be an Art.

But one can talk about Scientific art, or Art of Electronics... In this
sense, the art differs from technology in the way that it and the result of
it are so complex so it is done by intuition. Not because it can not be
learned and researched, but because it is too complex, unique.

Art requires certain level of perfection. If it is not perfect enough - it
is not art. That is reflected in feelings: what is not perfect - requires
some extra effort to do, to work with - it does not feel good, therefore it
is not art. It is an attempt to make art.

In another way, there are 2 definitions of art. First, art as the way of
creation, when the creator experience heavenly pleasure, and second: the
result of it, product, which is often on sale. I believe the first one is
the true one. It seems to me, you too. The second one - it is just something
to pay money for.

In this sense, any social dance done with heart, creatively, intuitively,
with enjoyment is art. That is one of the advantages of Tango. It allows
people experience the joy of creation with the simple means, and enjoy the
artistism of it if it feels well. Tango dancing as difficult as it is, is
not difficult in comparison to most other artistic activities.


Igor Polk
PS, The tricky question is "What is the painting on my wall - isn't it art
then?".
Answer: it depends on the way you are looking at it.

There is the Art of Enjoying Painting. Or not...

I laugh that these two subject are running alongside each other.  
I have had the interesting opportunity to be taught by someone who was more flaming then masculine. :) :)

Also when talking to people, the amount of times I have had to say... "NO it's Argentinian Tango, and NO I am not going to be covering myself in fake tan and wearing those baby blue sequined leggens!" 

Oh and don't get me started on the rose between the teeth thing, is that ever going to disappear.

I saw the most interesting thing last Friday at class. 
I was dancing with a woman who had been doing about a month less they I have. We danced together as the average 2 month educated, twice a week dancers would. There was some skill but still a little awkward, unbalanced and missing fluidity at times.

But when the teacher danced with her she looked like she had been dancing for a year. It was the fact that he knew how to lift and shift her weight. It was him guiding her and letting her body follow, to be completely honest she looked like she was hardly doing anything to taxing herself.

I came away with mixed emotions, one being surprised about how much the man does actually control and two, feeling a little ego bruised. They fact that she danced pretty badly with me, but danced incredibly with him was a bit of a shock. I took it very personally.

I wonder though and I don't mean to offend anyone with this. But from seeing this I think that women appear to progress quicker then men because they are lead. I mean you could take a complete novice and get her to do a beautiful ocho just by leading it well. You can't take a complete novice and get him to lead a beautiful ocho.

Also I have heard of couples (relationship) breaking up due to the woman feeling better dancing with a more experienced dancer, even though the two of them had started tango at the same time. I think it was because women feel like they dance well far quicker then men do. I see this in Milongas, women who have only just started dancing (like 2 months) go to milonga without fear. Men on the other hand would not set foot in a milonga in till they felt confident enough.

'Mash, that's real tango.

"Very personally" is absolutely the best way of taking it. Well done.

> > from seeing this I think that women appear to progress quicker then men 

The idea that it's due to her faster progress is an illusion created by 
the class teaching model. The real cause is that the woman is much further 
along the path before even the first lesson. That's because this dance is 
made to use what she's already got.

In my opinion this is the most important realisation of any guy's tango 
education. It totally changes his understanding of the dance and his 
approach to learning it.

You're fortunate to have got it in just a few weeks. And that's not down 
to luck. That's down to something /you've/ already got.

Go with it!

Like walking backwards in heels while feeling a force coming towards her
chest, to which she is supposed to respond by keeping her chest at location
and transfer that energy to her legs? And, oh yes, to not anticipate leads,
too.

In my opinion and experience, the first few hours of tango are more
difficult for women than men. Men only need to walk forward and exert energy
from their chest. They decide when to move and in what direction.

The balance appears to change somewhere in the first 10 hours of dancing, as
more movement options are taught to men. The men who are more cerebral start
to suffer at this point. ("How am I going to remember all of these STEPS?")
The men who enjoy and connect to the music and are satisfied with a simple
repertoire do much better.

Hi 'Mash,

Trini, here.  Cut yourself some slack.  While you're still
learning vocabulary, you're not going to be able to focus
as much on listening to your partner.  That's why your
teacher made your partner look so good - he doesn't need to
think about the steps and can just focus on her.  With
practice the same thing will happen with you.  Just take a
beginning woman with 0 months experience for a simple walk
onto the dance floor and you'll see.

You're right about women progressing more quickly because
they are danced with by guys who already know what they are
doing.  But beginning guys can also progress more quickly
by dancing with women who really know what they are doing. 
It is hard for beginners to work with other beginners. 
When tango was at its peak, beginners learned with
experienced dancers (mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles,
etc.), not with other beginners.  This is why there is so
much debate about how to teach tango to beginners en masse.
 It's relatively new territory.

So I would encourage you to ask good women dancers to
dance.  And if you've only been dancing for 2 months, many
women dancers will be inclined to say yes.  Take advantage
of this "honeymoon" period!  I often prefer dancing with a
beginner with a limited vocabulary than someone who's
trying these fancy steps because he's with an experienced
dancer.  You can always ask your teacher which women are
likely to say yes to you.  If you ask a woman, and she says
no, don't take it personally.  At your level, chances are
her saying no has nothing to do with you.   (But I wouldn't
recommend asking at a festival.)

A really good tanguera can make you feel as if you can do
anything.  You'll find yourself to be less clumsy, more
fluid, and, perhaps, even more inspired.  With a good
tanguera, even a novice can be inspired to lead an ocho or
imitate what he sees on the dance floor.  

Something you may want to do is take privates with a female
instructor if there's a good one in your area.  Not to be
sexist, but one of the issues for beginning men is getting
a practice partner.  So for an hour, you'll get both a
teacher and a good practice partner.

And any couple who supposedly breaks up over disparate
dance skills in tango had other issues.

Happy learning,
Trini de Pittsburgh

What Pablo's statement meant was that a woman can dance with men with 
different skills and she will dance differently.  A man, on the other 
hand cannot dance beyond his skills.

Taught like that, yes - hard. But that's not the way good followers do it.

> And, oh yes, to not anticipate leads, too.

That too is iatrogenic. The only girls I've met who anticipate are victims 
of the DIC* classes - she's following not her guy but the programming of a 
now-absent instructor who taught her the 'correct' girl step to accompany 
each guy step.

> the first few hours of tango are more difficult for women than men.

Only in the perverted world of the DIC classes. In the real world, the 
woman has it easier from the very first moment. Because the dance is made 
as something to be given to her by the guy.

> A man dances the tango for the woman.
> A man who dances with himself should be sitting a lot.

On that we agree - 100%.

Dude, you need to get out of your deep-backwater part of
England, more. :)

Women can "learn" to anticipate just by watching other
women at a milonga, as any guy who has had his leg hung
onto by a woman who wants to do a leg wrap (whether it's
lead or not) can tell you.

No, it's not the DIC method that's causing it.  It's
sometimes just overenthusiasm.

Happy tangos,
Trini de Pittsburgh

This is intriguing! Please describe the fight in detail! Did other patrons get 
involved? What sort of food was used as your weapons? Did anyone require 
medical help?

>Would you be so kind as to explain what you mean by "Structure of the

As no one else is tackling this question, I will try with the hopes that 
someone will improve upon my comments.

There are two different chains of dancers/instructors who have developed 
systems for organizing the possibilities of tango.

One chain was created in a group of dancers led by Petroleo (Carlos 
Estevez) and Salvador Sciana.  Mingo Pugliese was one of the youngest 
members of the group and he is credited for distilling the groups thinking 
into a systematic approach to tango.  Mingo distilled the innovative 
concepts developed by Petroleo and Salvador Sciana during the golden age 
of tango into systems of generalized eight-count right and left turns 
(giros) that can be used as a frame of reference for all turning steps 
including giros, molinettes, enrosques and ganchos.

Another chain was started by Gustavo Naveira and involves people such as 
Fabian Salas, Chicho Frumboli (and possibly Pablo Veron).  Naveira with 
contributions from his compratiots developed a systematic way for looking 
at all the movement possibilities in tango.  Walking is divided into 
parallel and crossed systems.  Turns are seen as two sets of four-count 
right and left turns.  Ochos are seen as part of the sytem of turns, 
boleos are seen as interuptions in turns, back ochos are seen as 
equivalent with crossed walking. 

If we think of the dance as being made up of these elements discovered by 
these dancers/professors, we develop an understanding of the structure of 
the dance

I recommend reading Brian Dunn's interview with Gustavo Naveira:
http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2006/msg04984.html
http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2006/msg05040.html

Some video tapes come to mind for a visual representation--those by 
Gustavo Naveira and Olga Besio and those by Daniel Trenner.
See: http://www.tejastango.com/video_resources.html#Structure

The Pugliese videos might also be helpful, but they are bit less direct 
that they are teaching from a structural system.
See http://www.tejastango.com/bridge_tango.html#Pugliese

With best regards,
Steve

Hi Mash,

Don't listen too much to what people tell you. You've seen the truth with your own 2 eyes and no amount of
rationalisation can change it. You're right - at beginner level, Tango is much easier for women than men because
the man leads. Yes, I can easily lead a woman after an 8-week beginner course and make her look and feel great.
My partner, who's a much better dancer than me, can't do the same thing with the men. You just have to accept
that it's going to take you a lot longer and you're going to have to work a lot harder than the women to reach the
same level. And don't take it personally - it's just the nature of the dance and every guy goes what you're going
through now.

As for couples breaking up - if they're already together when they start to learn, it usually isn't a problem. But
don't get too attached to any girl you meet in the beginner class because no matter how much she might like you,
she'll move on to a better partner in the next class. Pretty girls can always pick and choose from the better
dancers and after you've been learning for a few months, beginner girls will start to seek you out. But still don't
get too attached because they'll quickly overtake you and move on to even better partners. This might happen to
you many times as girls starting even 1-year after you will soon overtake you and move on to even better
partners. But, eventually, things will turn around. Work hard and practice and, eventually, you'll be one of the
best dancers in your community and then you can do the picking and choosing; then you can start to enjoy the
sweet fruit of your labours. At least, that's what I see and am told by my former students. I have no personal
experience because I'm married .... sigh.

 Keith, HK

Sorry, I can't see the sense of this; if, as Cacho
Dante says,
"Guys, to dance tango, you must listen to the heart of
the woman"
 the the man has to adapt to the woman, not the other
[patriarchal] way round. I find I have to dance
differently according to the way my partners move. The
whole purpose of the exercise is to make the most
diabolically useless woman look, & feel, good.

As for Pablo Pugliese, after "experiencing" him on
several occasions in our London, UK, milongas, I can't
help concluding he was speaking for himself. He has
yet to find where the stage finishes and the
dancefloor begins....Like many of the recent spate of
gurus from Bs As who, with their elaborate
circomvoluted spaghetti-junction moves take up so much
space that everybody else on the floor has to give
them a very broad & wide berth. As a consequence, they
do not practically feel the need to develop any
navigational skills, but still find time to preach
about them.

Cheers,

Andy.

I think many of us who have been dancing for a while write and talk about 
the structure of tango without really defining what we mean.  I'm 
expanding on my previous post.

If we think of tango as being made up of individual movements and 
sequences of movements (step patterns), the structure of tango is the 
fabric from which these movements are drawn.  Elements of the 
structure of tango were discovered and systemized by two different groups 
of dancers/instructors.

One such approach emerged from a group of dancers led by Petroleo (Carlos 
Estevez) and Salvador Sciana during the golden age of tango.  The group 
explored and developed turns.  Mingo Pugliese was one of the youngest 
members of the group, and he is credited for distilling the group's 
thinking into a systematic approach to teaching turns (giros) as 
generalized eight-count right and left turns.  The system serves as a 
frame of reference for creating all turning steps including giros, 
molinettes, enrosques and ganchos.

Another approach emerged from a group of dancers led by by Gustavo Naveira 
and has included such other dancers/teachers as Fabian Salas, Chicho 
Frumboli, and (possibly) Pablo Veron.  With 
contributions from his then partner, Olga Besio, and some of his 
compatriots, Naveira developed a systematic way for looking at all the 
movement possibilities in tango.  Some of the concepts included parallel 
and crossed systems of walking, ochos as part of the system of turns, 
boleos as an interuption of turns, and the equivalence between cross 
walking and back ochos.  Naveira's system serves as a frame of reference 
for creating all tango steps.  In addition, the system help bring into 
visibility some step patterns such as overturn ochos and a change of 
direction in turns that were not previously used with much frequency.

These underlying structures can provide a frame of reference and an 
encyclopedia of tango movement.  Mastery of these structures can greatly 
increase the fluidity of a tango dancer's improvisational skills.  (What 
is required for such mastery, I will leave for further discussion, but it 
takes much more than 6 weeks.)

Some of the structural elements of tango are:

     Walks (Caminatas)
           parallel foot, in line
           parallel foot, outside right
           parallel foot, outside left
           cross foot, in line
           cross foot, outside right
           cross foot, outside left
           arrastres or barridas (drags or sweeps)
     Turns (Giros)
           forward ocho
           backward ocho
           giro
           giro with sacadas
           boleo/amague
           molinete (with lapiz)
           enrosque
           forward enrosque
           arrastres or barridas (drags or sweeps)
           planeo
           change of axis steps
           change of direction steps
     Sandwiches (Mordidas)
     Embellishments (Adornos, Firuletes)
     Structural Connections
           basic step as a hallway
           basic step as a turn
           parallel and cross foot walking
           interchangability between back ochos and cross-foot walking
           lapiz-enrosque

For further reading,  I recommend reading Brian Dunn's interview with 
Gustavo Naveira:
http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2006/msg04984.html
http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2006/msg05040.html

For a visual representation I recommend the videos by Gustavo Naveira and 
Olga Besio and those by Daniel Trenner.
See: http://www.tejastango.com/video_resources.html#Structure

The Pugliese videos might also be helpful, but I find those videos are bit 
less direct about the fact they are teaching from a structural system.
See http://www.tejastango.com/bridge_tango.html#Pugliese

Even better attend the Gustavo Naveira workshops that are upcoming

With best regards,

Hi Andrew,

Perhaps I can add some insight into what I think Nina
means.

If a man decides that he doesn't want to lead volcadas,
colgadas, back ochos, or whatever, he doesn't have to learn
how to do it.  (BTW, I actually had a student who once
decided that he didn't want to lead back ochos, so he never
did it.  He didn't advance very far, but I had to respect
his choices.)

However, a woman can't just decide that she just doesn't
want to do back ochos, or forward ochos, or turns.  Even a
novice going to her first milonga is likely to experience
an ocho or molinete even if she's never been taught.

So the man is limited by what he knows moreso than a woman
is.

As a follower who also leads, a lot of what I do AS A
LEADER comes from what I personally experience as a
follower.  So I learn how certain men time things, how they
lead things.  I take those experiences as a follower into
my dance when I lead and I try to recreate those
experiences for my partner.

Dear David,

You asked about the ?structure? of Tango.

Perhaps this will help.

I think learning the Tango is like learning to speak a foreign  
language.  This can be taught  on different levels. If we consider  
the phrase ?See Spot run? as analogous to dancing Tango, you can:

1. Learn ?See Spot run? as a dance pattern.
2. Learn that ?Spot? is a noun, ?run? is a verb, and learn to dance  
the pattern ?See Spot Run.?
3. Learn that this dance pattern has a noun and a verb and based on  
the syntax (rules) of the language (dance), the verb follows the noun  
(expect in some questions). The latter would be learning the  
structure of Tango. You can then become a fluent dancer (not limited  
to ?See Spot run?). You can then put together an infinite variety of  
nouns and verbs, because you have assimilated the syntax of the dance.

Since different teachers use different approaches, you sometimes have  
to translate what is being taught into your own language.

Hope this helps.

Norm

I guess you think it's pure coincidence that the DIC lessons have women 
spend hours watching and then imitating another woman's movements.

Stephen there are in fact many more people who have proposed or authored
their own
systemization of tango.

- Mauricio Castro's tango discovery system
- Los Dinzels wrote An Anxious Quest for Freedom and also several dance
manuals
- Juan Carlos Copes wrote Bailemos Tango
- Christine Dennisten
- Chan Park "Tango Zen"

Unlike other books on Tango which focus on history, culture, travel or
music, these books
are about dance techniques, body concepts, and lead-follow.  Nowadays we
see less
instructors spending time to write down their ideas as they can just
tape the presentation
for their instructional video.  But reading the words bring out the
author's intention more
clearly.

Hi Chris,

The reality is that if a beginning woman goes to a milonga
or a practica on a fairly regular basis, she's likely to be
lead into stuff like boleos or ganchos or paradas before
she is even taught those elements in class.  In fact, when
Sean & I finally teach some of those things in a class
setting, we have to teach the women what is NOT a gancho or
boleo or whatever.

That's why I said that it can just be overenthusiasm. It's
normal for women to want to do pretty things on the dance
floor.  So they watch other women, who may unfortunately
not be the best role models, and try to imitate them. 
Since the pressure for women is to move and do the step,
they tend to anticipate.  They want to be "right", but that
is somewhat independent of teaching style.  If a woman only
dances with good leaders, then anticipation is less likely
to happen.  

But let's get real.  A beginning woman cannot tell a good
leader from a bad leader as readily as an experienced
dancer can.  And she may try to please a mediocre leader
more than a good leader.  Beginners are easily impressed.

i lead and follow and it has been my experience that it is more  
challenging to lead at the beginning of learning tango and that, as  
time goes by, it becomes more challenging to follow.

my rationale is:
there is so much to learn at the beginning for leaders....  
navigation, musicality, steps, balance, leading another person, etc.   
after leaders become more proficient, many of them complain of being  
bored because they can only dance to their own repertoire of movements.

for followers, the beginning is easier but as they progress, they  
become more and more challenged to "accomodate" "adapt" to their  
leaders and all the various styles, steps etc.  remember followers  
never know from step 1 what will happen in the dance.  it may be  
something you have never experienced before.

my 2 cents

 I think Stephen Brown has dug a deep hole for himself and is now struggling to get out. In an earlier post he blithely gave
 'Structure of the Dance' as the 3rd of his 4 Layers of Tango Learning and, now, it's becoming increasingly apparent that
 he has no real idea about what that means. All he can do is refer to other teachers and make a list of some of the more
 common steps and figures that are danced in Tango.

 If he either doesn't understand it or just can't explain it - how can it be such an important element im Learning Tango?

 'Structure of the Dance' sounds like another ploy to overly-complicate the process of learning Tango. It really isn't that
 complicated - just go to class, don't think about it too much and you'll learn how to dance. Leave the theory alone until 
 you want to start sounding important on Tango-L.

Subject: [Tango-L] Effective Practice
Message-ID: <942887.60041.qm@web55301.mail.re4.yahoo.com>

Despite some recent acrimony on the 'L, the discussion
produced at least one intriguing idea. Namely Jake's
observation that no one of us is able to practice for our
students. The most effective exercise ever devised is
worthless if the students don't use it. While it is true
that we can not practice for our students, I think two
things separate successful teachers from the practitioners
of the 5 year plan. First, they motivate their students to
practice, and second, they teach their students how to
practice effectively. I'm sure most teachers can point to a
few of their beginners who are self motivated to practice.
They are the easy students, and they are definitely in the
minority.

And even those beginners who are self motivated to practice
usually try to repeat the steps they learned in class with
other beginners as partners. I think this is ineffective
practice. The students are basically training bad habits
into their body. Students cannot walk if they can't balance
on one foot. They can't pivot if they can't twist while
balanced on one foot. Learning to balance and to twist is
boring compared to fumbling around with your partner, but
it is effective. It produces results.

Likewise, to practice cadencia with a partner requires
knowing how to lead different size steps, different timing,
and weight changes. By the time students learn all that,
it's too late to start learning cadencia. (OK, it's never
too late, but that's the 5 year path.) For beginners to
practice musicality, they must dance alone. Of course, to
learn lead and follow, beginners must practice together. So
they need both. Motivate them to try this each week: 1.5
hours of class, 2.5 hours practicing alone (about 20 min
per day), and 2 hours with partners.

The difficulty in motivating students to practice is that
practice must become a new habit. That means a change in
lifestyle, no longer how minor that change might be. For
most people who feel constantly rushed, and pulled in many
different directions, finding even 20 minutes a day to
practice seems insurmountable. We have had some luck by
linking a tango practice habit to other habits. More on
that later.

Another difficulty is getting students to practice
effectively without supervision. People have been walking
for most of their lives. But, as Manuel pointed out, most
people don't complete each step with their weight on one
foot. Sending them home from their first class with
instructions to practice walking is not going to help this.
Before they can walk to one foot, they need to learn to
stand on one foot. And that they can certainly practice
alone. At the end of the first class, I ask all of the
students to stand on one foot. Then I take about 60 seconds
to explain the importance of balance. I have yet to meet a
beginner who can balance on one foot for 60 seconds. But
they all see that I can easily do it, while talking and
twisting to make eye contact with everyone in the room. I
tell them that for homework, they are to practice standing
on each leg every day. It's a new habit, and a boring
exercise, so I tie it to an existing habit. I tell them to
practice standing on one leg in the morning when they brush
their teeth, and the other leg at night when they brush
their teeth.

At the beginning of the second class, repeat the exercise.
Most people will not have improved because they didn't
practice. But a few will have shown marked improvement. A
little praise for those who do the work is enough to
motivate the others to get with the program. They get
assigned the same exercise the second week. Anyone who
managed a full 60 seconds gets to try it with their eyes
closed. (hehehe)

It occurs to me that someone one this list is going to
argue that learning to stand on one foot has nothing to do
with dancing tango. If you can't see the direct benefit of
balance to tango, at least consider the secondary benefit:
getting people into the habit of daily practice. Once they
can stand still on one foot, I presume that future tango
dancers need to develop enough balance to move their free
leg. Now they have to move out of the bathroom, or they
will kick the sink. Can they separate the tango practice
habit from the oral hygiene habit? Tune in next week for
the shocking answer.

Sean

P.S. Sorry for the dramatic cliff hanger. Maybe others will
share their experiences with motivating people to practice
while we wait...

Subject: [Tango-L] 1930s - Tango Soviet Union Argentina
Message-ID: <151916936@web.de>

Hi Nina, Igor,
 
as to tango crossing boarders in Poland Soviet Union and Argentina:
Jerzy Petersburgski, born 1897in Warsaw in a family of famous Klezmer musicians composed the tango "ta ostatnia niedziela" (last sunday), 1936,  text by Zenon Fridland, singer Mechislav Fogg. Recording label Sirena elektro. 

In 1935 the song was exported to the Soviet Union, got well known under the Russian title "utemlennye solncem", recording 1937, interpreted by Iosif Al'bek. The song might be well know to US public as title song of the Academy Award winning film by Nikital Mikhailkov (Burnt by the sun, 1994). 

You can download the songs here (historical recording Mechislav Fogg: ostatnia niedziela /  / Pola Negri: tango notturno / utemlennye solcncem). On this website you can also read about why "last sunday" was called "song of death"
http://nfo.net/euro/ep.html

When in 1939 Poland was divided, many Jewish musicians in Lvov or Bialystok found themselves citizens of Belorussia. Jerzy Petersburgski was one of them. He founded the Belorussian republican jazz orchestra, 25 musicians, in Belostok.

As consequence of Spanish Civil War 1936-1939, many refugees and orphaned children from Spain entered the Soviet Union. With this the phenomen might be linked that Spanish music and latin-american melodies got very popular in these years, especially tango music and gypsy songs. They were interpreted by singers like Isabella Jureva, Claudia Shulzhenko, Georgi Vinogradov, Leonid Utesov. 

Petr Leshchenkos also interpreted tangos composed by Jerzy Petersburgkij, Leshchenkos tangos from Rumania entered the Soviet Union illegally,  his work was oficially banned. Nevertheless, secretly he was very popular: specialists would even bootleg his music onto "ribs" (used X-ray plates), as a form of pirate copies. 

After second world war Jerzy Petersburgski lived in Argentin from 1948-1968 and worked for radio el mundo in Buenos Aires

In 1953 the Soviet Union imported films with Lolita Torres(Beatriz Mariana Torres).

She was very popular in the Soviet Union for her films and her recordings of tango music, travelled to the Soviet Union 14 times. See:

The Russian website offers some of her recordings from the 1950s and 1960s, but in the file format VQF.

Recently I have been approached by beginner level dancersasking me about close embrace dancing.  It appears that in certain milongasdanced the USdancers believe that close embrace is the only way to dance tango.  One interestingT-Shirt worn by a male dancer claimed: &#8220;Real Man Dance Close Embrace&#8221;The t-shirt was for a St. Louis Argentine Tango event.

 

I sincerely hope that this topic generate constructivecommentaries PLEASE  no flaming.

 

I feel that both close and open embrace serve different andequally important functions.  Shouldn&#8217;t we as dancers be comfortable andfluent in all aspects of the dance?  If so, what are the benefits ofcriticizing and dismissing one style over the other?

 

If our archives contain past exchanges in this topic cansomeone provide me dates?

As I see it, there are several reasons for dancing tango in close embrace:


(1) Cultural Validity

At the milongas in Buenos Aires, essentially everyone is dancing tango in
close embrace. If there is any opening, it is momentary, e.g., to do turns.
although in the commomly danced 'milonguero style' even that is not done.
Dancing  in open embrace, as is universally taught, mimics tango for the
stage, not tango for social dancing in Buenos Aires.  If you dance tango in
an open embrace, the question you need to ask yourself is whether it is
important for you to dance tango as it is danced in the milongas  of Buenos
Aires. It is certainly not essential to do so, because the norm outside
Buenos Aires is to dance tango at milongas in an open embrace. Thus, doing
the latter evolved social form is culturally valid for the culture in which
it is practiced. Historically, a similar transformation has occurred in the
evolution of the ballroom dances that use the name 'tango'.

One could argue that the handful of 'practicas' at Villa Malcolm and
elsewhere where nuevo tango is danced make dancing this style of dancing
culturally valid in Buenos Aires, but consider this comprises less than 10%
of tango venues and even a smaller percentage of dancers and that this is a
new phenomenon that has existed for less than a decade.


(2) Quality of Dance

Dancing tango in close embrace feels different than in open embrace. The
close embrace is more intimate and permits greater sharing of emotion. It
also allows for more subtle interpretation of the music (i.e., movements,
weight changes, rhythm changes are more subtle). However, open embrace
allows for greater outward dramatic expression through larger and more
conspicuous movements. Many dancers find this quality of open embrace tango
attractive, particularly in cultures where exhibition in social dance is
valued.


(3) Ease in Learning and Retention

Dancing tango in close embrace uses simpler movements and is less difficult
to learn. In open embrace separation between partners, larger movements, and
more frequent use of conspicuous decorative elements makes greater demands
on balance. In Buenos Aires one finds few people over 35 dancing teh open
embrace nuevo tango style. Almost everyone over 40 dances in close embrace
all of the time and there are a significant number of dancers in their 70s,
even some in their 80s dancing likewise.


- Another issue:

Mixing close and open embrace dancers at a milonga can often create conflict
over space. Open embrace dancers often see close embrace dancers as blocking
the line of dance. Close embrace dancers often see open embrace dancers are
offering potential for collision because of their larger movements, which
are also more difficult to control (balance issues, greater speed of
movement).


My opinion is that if you want to experience what tango has to offer as a
social dance that is unique, close embrace will provide greater emotional
connection and more possibilities for musical interpretation,
characteristics that exist in no other social dance.

'Open embrace' is, of course, an oxymoron. The proper term for the posture
is 'dance frame'.

However, 'open embrace' are being used by those who wish to make statements
like 'I dance Argentine Tango' without really having to learn the dance.
-Usually the same people who put Bryan Adams on the stereo and call it
'alternative tango'.

So; if you dance a dance where you utilize a dance frame and dance to pop or
rock, you are not dancing tango.

It's pretty simple, really.

Ron, I do respect you a lot and always valued your opinions, but I have to
disagree with you on almost all points you have made.

1. Cultural Validity "At the milongas in Buenos Aires, essentially everyone
is dancing tango in close embrace"

I haven't been to BA, but I have seen a lot of movies and documentaries and
photos including old ones, and everywhere open and close embrace are equally
presented. Including dance danced in 1910-1940 in Europe and America.


2. Quality of Dance. "The close embrace is more intimate and permits greater
sharing of emotion."

No, they are equal. Open embrace can be more intimate than close embrace.
How? Ask me personally. Emotions are transferred by artistic abilities.


3. Dancing tango in close embrace uses simpler movements and is less
difficult to learn.

Tango in close embrace is more difficult to learn ( if you do not stick to
absurd Naveira or Neo Tango over complicated open embrace concepts )


4. "open embrace allows for greater outward dramatic expression"

Absolutely not: Gavito. Close embrace dancing is more dramatic and attracts
attention of general crowd much more. ( If you know how to dance
attractively )


5. "In open embrace separation between partners, larger movements, and
more frequent use of conspicuous decorative elements makes greater demands
on balance."

Close embrace demands balance much more. Close embrace does not forgive
mistakes easily overlooked in open embrace. 


6. Mixing close and open embrace dancers at a milonga can often create
conflict over space.

Absolutely not. Once can dance closely large, and open small.
But the energy is different, yes. Some music is better to dance in open,
some - in close. Music should dictate in what embrace to dance. To everyone.


7. "Open embrace dancers often see close embrace dancers as blocking the
line of dance."

Beginners block the line of dance no matter what embrace they dance in. I
agree that modern trend in close embrace shockingly promotes blocking the
line of dance - somebody teaches that they should not progress around the
floor or stop for too long. That is the flaw ( I hope temporary ) of
teaching and modern situation, not the dancing position.

==========================
Open and close embrace are equal in emotional connection and possibilities
for musical interpretation as well as stage impressions and technical
complexity if one wishes so or simplicity if situation demands.

True that they are different, but otherwise they are equal.

List,

While Stephen has provided some useful info (for some readers here, 
anyway), I agree with Keith that he hasn't written of the underlying 
structure itself-- which is not the moves per se, but rather what makes 
them legible in a closed conceptual system.

E.g., observations like:
    * The dancers are always in either parallel (aka normal) or 
cross-system, unless someone is standing on both feet (or on their partner)
    * Whenever one dancer steps (changes weight) while the other does 
not, the system changes
    * Walking steps are either "open" or "crossed" (in front or 
behind)-- this one I've disputed at length
    * Turns/pivots have a center and a circumference
    * Both dancers cannot stand in the same place at the same time
    * A cruzada is just a step in place on the other side of one's foot
    * When it's neither led nor followed, you call it an "embellishment" 
(although if you can figure out how to lead it, you get to make up a 
stupid nickname)

This is structure-- an expression in all variables, which you cannot 
choreograph (as is) because it has no particulars. A list of moves 
(which you _can_ choreograph) is simply the tangible material in which 
structure, otherwise latent, may be discerned.

I notice that the structure of pivots has not yet (to my knowledge) been 
fully explored. My previous posts on analysis began to unravel the 
problems of a step-centric structure, but I'm still working on it 
intermittently.

Yes, we should be comfortable in all aspects of the dance. 
  (I'm reluctant to add fluidity to that sentence, because my 
  "fluency" might be your "boy, he has a limited vocabulary".)
   
  It is unfortunate that people become so dogmatic about one 
  or another style. Who creates the climate that induces this
  dogmatism? Well, I have a theory or two, but am reluctant to 
  point fingers.
   
  One thought is that perhaps the T shirt was meant to be
  humorous. In the country western world, there is a saying 
  that "real cowboys don't line dance". Well, real cowboys 
  can't line dance. And there is the humor of it.
   
  I love dancing apilado close embrace. And sometimes my 
  enthusiasm for that style is perceived as a dismissal of other
  styles. It is nowhere as easy to learn to do well, however, 
  than the apparently easy to do "close embrace".
   
  Is another long dicussion of styles inevitable?

  I feel that both close and open embrace serve different andequally

all aspects of the dance?  If so, what are the benefits ofcriticizing
and dismissing one style over the other?

I would be interested in seeing film footage from the Golden Age showing
people dancing at the milongas.

In Buenos Aires in the 21st century, close embrace is the standard embrace.
Open embrace is rare outside of the nuevo clubs.

For the other points below, the differences can be attributed to personal
interpretation. However, many of my tango colleagues (including some from
Buenos Aires) share the perspective I've stated. However, I will agree that
close embrace is much less fogiving of mistakes. As for Gavito, he was
unique. He demonstrated more drama and passion because he was Gavito, not
because he opened or closed the embrace.

Igor,

This is not meant to dispute you in particular, but your comments provide
the context for further elaboration.

Imagine this. You're at a milonga. The club is crowded and the temperature
is warm. The DJ is playing great music and the sound system is clear. (BA
milongas tend to play music more loudly than US milongas.) The tanda just
starting is Calo - Beron or Demare - Beron. For me it could also be Di Sarli
- Podesta, Troilo - Fiorentino, possibly even Tanturi - Castillo or Biagi -
Amor. You spot a women with warm smile. She responds to your invitation to
dance. As you embrace, she extends her arm over your shoulder
affectionately, drawing you closer to her gently. She places her cheek
firmly in contact with yours. As you dance, the emotion of the music
overcomes both of you. Your breathing becomes heavier, also more
synchronous. The two of you move and breathe as one. The heat of the club
and the passion of the dance releases sweat on your face. The sweat on your
cheeks intermingle. The scent of her perfume, now amplified, premeates your
nostrils. You forget where you are. You don't have to think where you are
going - the music and the space on the floor guides you. Time seems to stop.
You are at peace.

This experience cannot be achieved in open embrace. It can only be achieved
dancing tango in close embrace. It's something that makes tango a special
unique experience.

Message-ID: <c79.1869ffed.33d3d3d5@aol.com>

     
 
Here's the deal:
Women could give a rip what the steps are.  We care  about how they feel.
 
If the embrace feels  good, the steps will likely feel good,  in open frame 
or close embrace.  Simple or complex.   

The man's task involves making the dance interesting, and that  involves 
rhythmic interpretations, changes of direction, etc.  If the  embrace is 
comfortable, we are ok with simple steps led with tenderness  and musicality.  If the 
embrace is uncomfortable, the fanciest  steps in the world will be 
uncomfortable and will not please  us.
 
We love changes of direction and intimate check steps, but our  top priority 
is how you hold us.  If the embrace feels nice enough to  just stand there and 
not even move, we know the dance will be good.   This is the main reason 
that, in our opinion, some leaders can become  "good"  in a relatively short time. 
 If they understand that we  care more about how the dance feels than how it 
looks or what steps are  involved, they "get it."
 
To please the woman, concentrate on the embrace, then the  steps.

Hi Ron and Igor,

I dance both close and open embrace although probably not nearly as well as
either of you (I have about two years total experience).  Anyway, I
certainly have had some wonderful dances over the two years in both
embraces.  Looking back, I don't think what made the special dances so
special was so much the embrace as it was the connection, the sharing, the
music, the other dancers, the energy, my emotion (and hers). If I look back
at what I would consider my best (meaning most pleasant) open embrace dance,
I really don't believe that particular experience would have been 'still
better yet', had we been in close embrace.  On the other hand, i have had
many wonderful dances in close embrace.  For me, my partners ability/desire,
the music, the floor conditions, all play a roll in which embrace I/we
chose. So - while I can easily believe for any one individual, close or open
may be superior or most pleasant, enlarging it to the tango community, I
believe/hope there is room, tolerance, enjoyment for all in their chosen
embrace.

I have never been to BA, but I guess if I were, and if most of the followers
there preferred close embrace, that would probably be my choice too.  The
other leaders/couples on the floor are also very important to me.  If I
thought leading a particular open embrace movement would be distracting to
them, I would not lead it.  The dance is more than just me and my partner,
it is all of us on the floor together, being one.

Best of Luck to you both, and all reading this. The dance is big enough for
all styles, It is possible (I believe) to like both chamber music and rock
and roll.  They don't have to be exclusive.

Ed

There is only one embrace.  It becomes closer or more open depending 
on the crowd, the music, the partner, the movement, etc.  The embrace 
accommodates the dance and the dancers.

The separation of styles in terms of "close" and "open" embrace came 
from the foreigners that began trying to make sense of tango in the 
early 1980s.  People noticed a clear difference between the social 
embrace and the stage embrace when the show Tango Argentino roared 
through the world in the 1980s.  The open thing to which Neil 
accurately refers to as a "frame" came from that 
interpretation.  Frame does exist in ballroom dances and is a part of 
the vocabulary that was used by the foreigners in regard to Argentine tango.

In a real sense, what is called "open" social embrace now, began 
outside of Argentina and is a result of a misunderstanding that stage 
tango is not social tango.  That distance between partners is much 
needed on stage, just like the dreaded back step.  Without the space 
between partners, the dancers are invisible to the audience.  On 
stage, everything has to be made bigger.  Without the back step, 
dancers would eventually fall off the stage.  So both of these 
elements, dreaded by many social dancers, are much needed on 
stage.  But on a social dance floor,  they are silly - they do not 
serve the purpose of an intimate exchange that social tango calls 
for.  What goes on between partners in a dance is a secret.  It is 
private and is contained by the embrace.  What goes on on stage is 
entertainment and is meant for public to see.

So, open=stage, close=social.  Artistic license is allowed on stage only.

There is another extreme called "milonguero" style.  The word was 
coined by Susana Miller in the early 90's to describe the classes 
that she was offering, which were meant to give people a quick 
ability to attend milongas.  Since milongas are very crowded, many 
were satisfied learning just a few movements and not much technique 
and still be able to do something on a crowded dance floor.  I know 
this from a person who was there when the term was first 
used.  Milongueros never used that term.  Each one had developed his 
own style and was very proud of it.  And each one was very different 
from the others.

Argentines always knew that there is only one tango embrace.  This 
embrace is danced very differently when they dance to D'Agostino than 
when they dance to Pugliese.  Many of the older dancers (milongueros, 
if you wish) change the embrace ever so slightly to accommodate the 
bigger music of Pugliese and they do change the movements of the 
dance.  But it is subtle.

Argentine dancers take great pride in their embrace.  Each one takes 
incredible care of how to embrace his/her partner.  People have 
mannerisms that are uniquely their own.  Embrace is precious to 
them.  It is at the core of the dance.  It is the soul of the dance 
between the two partners.  The "frame" configurations where a man is 
holding a woman with his hands instead of arms hits at the pride of 
Argentine male dancers because no self-respecting man would hold a 
woman that way.

Embrace...  tango embrace...  Amaury, what have you done?!  This 
thing goes back to the culture, cultural values, men and women in a 
culture and other powerful things.  How men relate to women and women 
to men determines whether they dance in a frame or in an embrace.

When beginner male AT students approach me with a question "Do you 
think I can learn to dance this?", I don't tell them yes, if you can 
walk, you can dance.  Instead, I tell them that if they know how to 
hold a woman in their arms, they might be able to learn this dance.

My very best regards to everyone,

Nina

Comparing open & close embrace:
It seems to me, the decision regarding the embrace is made by each  
couple. It is how they agree to communicate with each other.
Which ever they choose (or a combination), sets the tone for their  
Tango together, including "intimacy."
If they choose open, that is the most intimate. If they choose close,  
that is the most intimate.

Well said Ron!!!!
 
Finally somebody has described, in my opinion perfectly,  the emotions 
involved when a connection has been  met between two people dancing to a tanda of 
Calo, DiSarli or other  with their  so romantic Tangos !!!
 
I go definitely for the Apilado!!!!!!!

It's very interesting to read these types of threads. Generally I see a lot 
of defensiveness and hostility from the so-called close embrace gurus. I've 
never seen a single thread started by a regular salon style dancer attacking 
the "apilado" style. The reverse is often true, I really don't know why some 
people get so hung up on this subject. It's preposterous to keep harping on 
the evils of "open embrace" and the goodness and light of "close embrace". I 
found this clip of some dancers dancing a regular salon style and doing 
firuletes and figures. These guys and their partners I belive are quite 
genuine, authentic Argentine tango dancers. Anybody who would question their 
bona fides needs to go back and re-start their tango education ;-)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN617i5dB2s

It was a birthday party for Alberto Paz, the guys dancing are Mingo & Ester 
Pugliese, Facundo & Kely posadas and Pupi Castello and Graciela.

Enjoy!

Oh, BTW, in case some of you are wondering, I dance promarily in a close 
embrace style ;-)

Manuel,

I have seen all of these dancers at numerous milongas over the last 
10 years (with an exception of Ester Pugliese)  and have seen none of 
them dance like this when they are dancing socially.  When they are 
showing off their dance, sure!  But not socially in the milongas.

I think this discussion has come around about 6-7 times in the last 
decade or so.

Best,

Nina

Dear tango friends,

I just read this in a local NO forum. It's a note from Alberto Paz and 
Valorie Hart. It's with great sadness I quote this to all of you:

Dear friends,

Pupi Castello passed away surrounded by family and friends at 8:30 AM
this morning Buenos Aires time.

Another giant of the Argentine tango has left us, and we mourn, we
grief but also rejoice celebrating the life of a man who gave luster
and class to the word 'milonguero.'

Pupi's prime disciple, partner and friend Graciela Gonzalez was at
his bedside hours after she returned to Buenos Aires. After a long
night, Ernesto Norberto Castello, known by all as Pupi slipped into
an eternal rest.

Subject: [Tango-L] Scenes from the milonga
Message-ID: <012601c7cbf1$a3ef6300$838f3dc8@JANIS>

Friday was Dia del Amigos when friends phone one another or get together.  A
list of a few friends to call could take hours if only one friend decides
she has time for a long chat.  It's a day when restaurants are booked in
advance for groups dining together.  It was sure to be a day when many would
show up in the milongas.

The milonga Entre tango y tango at Centro Region Leonesa begins at 6:00pm.
I was there at 6:45 to claim a table for two friends and myself.  Leonesa is
a large place in which to coordinate the seating of 375+ dancers and keep
all them happy.  It's a real challenge for Luis Trapasso who needs help.  He
has Stella collecting the money, but she should be the one seating people at
tables.  Stella's daughter collects tickets inside, but it's a long wait for
Luis to return and escort you to a table.  I found where I wanted to sit
nearby and made myself comfortable until Luis got around to noticing me.  He
wanted me to move to a table in front of the large speakers, but I refused.
I wear earplugs so the noise level is tolerable.  He offered me the table
next to where I was, and I agreed to move.

It wasn't long before Alfredo Barcones (77) arrived.  We had a pleasant chat
a month ago when I phoned to wish him a happy birthday.  Our conversation
focused on how things were years ago in the milongas and how much things
have changed.  It was about 7:00 and the floor was still quite open.
Alfredo invited me for a tanda.  After the first tango he told me that he
has to stop smoking because he has pain in his right leg.  He said his
hearing has been impaired since a recent bout with the flu.  He managed to
dance in spite of everything.  After the third dance of the tanda, he said
his leg was bothering him, so I asked if he wanted to sit down.  He insisted
on finishing the tanda with me.  Later I saw him out in the foyer where
dancers go to smoke.  There was Alfredo with a cigarette in his hand.

Around 9:00 my friends hadn't arrived yet, and Luis was running out of
tables.  He seated two women at my table.  I informed them they were welcome
to stay until my friends arrived.  There were other tables on the dance
floor, but they are reserved for the glamour girls.  They are the ones who
show up late when there are no more tables, but they have their reserved
seats.  They wouldn't come otherwise.  They are used to being catered to by
Luis and other organizers.  The glamour girls are a very small clique of
women.  They are over-55, attractive women who will dance with anyone.  The
important thing to them is they are dancing for almost every tanda.

One of the newest glamour girls is about 21.  Her father teaches tango, so
somehow she has made her way to a front-row table in every milonga for the
over-60 crowd without paying her dues.  I don't know if she dances where the
young crowd goes, but I've seen her dancing with Ricardo Suarez (83).
Friday she was wearing camouflage leggings, her first pair of Comme il Faut
shoes, and a hodgepodge of summer tops.  She used to dress more
appropriately for the milonga, but she's one of the trendsetters toward the
grunge style in the milongas.  Women with whom I've shared a table are never
at a loss for commentary about her.  She is successful in that she manages
to dance with the best dancers at a milonga.  She hasn't learned that she
should change into her dance shoes in the ladies' room.  That's like
changing in the gym before or after exercising rather than in the locker
room.  She's dancing practically every tanda with her eyes closed, so she
hasn't had an opportunity to learn much by watching.  You'll see her dancing
early at Leonesa and later at Lo de Celia.  She's the one with all the butt
action.

My deadline was 10:00pm to stay at Leonesa if my friends didn't arrive.
They didn't, so I went to change my shoes in the ladies' room and then walk
three blocks to Lo de Celia where I hadn't been for three months.  A person
informed me that my friends had just arrived.  I went searching for them
during a very loud tanda of tropical music when the lights were off.  I
suggested we leave and go to Celia's.  My table was occupied so there was no
place for us.  They asked for their money back, but Luis didn't want to
return it at first.  He finally agreed to after giving me a difficult time
about the table.  I realized that I didn't want to return to a place where I
didn't feel comfortable or welcome.  His milonga is the current place to be
on Friday evenings, but you won't find me there again.

No matter how many milongueros finally showed up at Leonesa, it wasn't
enough reason for me to stay.  Miguel Angel Balbi, Hugo Belvisi, Carlos
Bugarin, Jose Pantano, and Hector Delgado have been friends for fifty years.
Ernesto Delgado would have been with them if his health was better.  Carlos
Greco, Ricardo Franquelo, Fernando Iturrieta, Jorge Uzunian, Ricardo Suarez
and Dany Garcia were there.   I haven't seen Ismael Heljalil since he
stopped going to Celia's because of health problems.  It was nice to see him
able to dance again.  Enrique Rosich still runs a milonga although he isn't
able to dance.  I consider myself fortunate to have danced with all of them.

Lo de Celia is the place I call my second home.  It's the only place where
one is greeted like family at a milonga.  Celia Blanco has hired people who
make it happen.  The security guard greeted us at the street entrance.
Mario was there with a smile as he collected our entradas.  Olga took care
of our coats.  Dario escorted us to our table.  Carlitos and Johnny, the
waiters, greeted us as we walked to our table.  Dany Borelli, the best DJ in
BsAs, greeted us with a kiss.   Viviana at the bar welcomed us.  And later
when Celia arrived, she came to our table to thank us for coming.  Friday
was not only a celebration for Dia del Amigos; it was also the seventh
anniversary of Lo de Celia Tango Club.

My friends and I shared a bottle of Sidra while we listened to the music and
watched the dancing.  Celia provided sandwiches and cake for her 200 guests.
I was happy to find Rodolfo Indegno (76) in good health, and I enjoyed a
tanda with him.  We decided to leave around 3:00, but while walking down the
stairs, I heard another tanda of Di Sarli and had to return.  I thanked Dany
for the music he programs so well.  I'm not used to getting home at 4:00,
but it was a wonderful night at Lo de Celia.

When my female students are preparing for their first milonga, I always tell them one thing - while most men
are there to dance, there are a few who will be there to cuddle. Igor is definitely there to dance - not sure about
Ron. And, for you flamers out there, I don't mean that close embrace dancers are all cuddlers. Open embrace is easier 
to learn for Asian beginners but close embrace should always be the final goal. And, by then, they can dance both.

I hesitate to call it the 'Real Tango' but close embrace is what they do in BsAs and that's always the determining factor 
for me. Also, it just feels so damn good - the dancing I mean, not the cuddling :-).

Keith, HK

Here's the deal:
Women could give a rip what the steps are.  We care  about how they feel.
 
If the embrace feels  good, the steps will likely feel good,  in open frame 
or close embrace.  Simple or complex.   

The man's task involves making the dance interesting, and that  involves 
rhythmic interpretations, changes of direction, etc.  If the  embrace is 
comfortable, we are ok with simple steps led with tenderness  and
musicality.  If the 
embrace is uncomfortable, the fanciest  steps in the world will be 
uncomfortable and will not please  us.
 
We love changes of direction and intimate check steps, but our  top priority

is how you hold us.  If the embrace feels nice enough to  just stand there
and 
not even move, we know the dance will be good.   This is the main reason 
that, in our opinion, some leaders can become  "good"  in a relatively short
time. 
 If they understand that we  care more about how the dance feels than how it

looks or what steps are  involved, they "get it."
 
To please the woman, concentrate on the embrace, then the  steps.

Each of your sentences starts with a verb, and a noun ends each of them.

"A after B" (as above) is not structure, but mere sequence.

"But don't I need more vocabulary?"

So much for this analogy.

To my mind, the only real common ground between language and improv 
dancing lies in our capacity to split known terms into pieces (if we 
understand them), and recombine them in order to get ad hoc terms. But 
this presupposes that we already know what we're doing-- that we're 
rather more than fluent already. The only other similarity between the 
two is that the bulk of people who don't know what they're talking about 
feel entitled to share their wisdom on the topic.

I've got a better idea. How about... Learning to dance tango is like 
learning to _dance tango_.

Based on some of the class teaching I've seen, this is probably a very 
good thing. Provided the man actually knows how to lead her (which is 
the cornerstone of Chris' argument, which his opponents continue to 
overlook). But if he does know how to lead, he can probably tell that 
those things are uncalled for with a beginner.

Moreover, I know fine tango dancers who were never taught these things 
in any class. I know many, many more who have been taught them ten 
times, and who still can't get them right.

This is a virtual quotation of Chris' argument, isn't it?

I see this point refuted nearly every day. Women of any level, like men 
of any level, can tell when it's working and when it's not, and you know 
that as well as I do. Beginners are constantly lamenting the 
difficulties of working with each other in beginner-level classes.
> And she may try to please a mediocre leader more than a good leader.
And that's because a good leader will likely be pleasing her. With a 
mediocre leader, my bet is that she's trying to pacify him, or else not 
fall down.
> Beginners are easily impressed.
>   
I suspect the opposite.

We self-important tango assholes like to believe that so many people 
don't come back for a second lesson, or second month, because they're 
intimidated, or had a boo-hoo time, or some BS like that. And that's 
pure condescension on our part. Chances are, they just Weren't impressed.

What I see you doing here is mainly turning a blind eye to the validity 
of Chris' points, in order to defend "realities" which are unfortunate 
in the first place. If the men were generally better, I don't think we'd 
even be talking about this.

Therefore, improve the damn men.

Dance with the men. They need it more. When you feel that they're 
getting it, suggest partners who might be willing to show them what a 
woman should feel like in their arms.

The whole problem in most of these chick-based threads is the lack of 
good men. So make good men.

Oh, yes.  In our heads, we're all Al Pacino in that film. Pity the

Dear Keith and Nina,

I tend to agree with both of you... 

The thing is, that the tango world is not just Buenos Aires. As this is an English language mailing list, it is quite obvious that most of the readers are also not focused on Buenos Aires either. This means that both as dancers and teachers we are the products of different cultures which may have a different path or concept for our dancing (using "dancing" instead of "tango" was intentional). 

Most beginner dancers will be utterly unable to grasp most concepts that are obvious for "insiders"...like the embrace. 

Europeans I know have a difficulty with this. Hungarians are less shy or distance-keeping than many citizens of other European nations (cultures), but still when I show women how I imagine an embrace to feel like, they are usually blushing or telling me that it is maybe too intimate for them. They do not feel comfortable when embracing someone like that. To be honest, even general close embrace causes issues for many (of course, they do not realize this, just make "panic" related mistakes that are the direct results of having a partner in front of them). While women are having problems to accept the closeness and enjoy it, men have a problems as well. It is usually that they are either paralyzed having women in their path within a step or so, or they are unable to "feel" the presence of her and take notice of her position, movements, comfort level etc.

These are all psychological issues and people are more willing to learn STEPS than to participate in a quasi-therapy session (even if it is disguised as tango). Because of this many will seek out those teachers who do not make them face their intimacy issues and just teach steps, technique and no emotional stuff. Of course, with time many will discover the emotional part for themselves, but they'll never learn how far (how strong) that may go. Of course, it helps if the teaching couple has a really strong connection (both in-dance and in life) which may be a model for their dancing.

I do not say that it can't be taught in the beginning though. Once I had a student from the US who had a really, really sweet embrace. She was a beginner with less than 6 months of experience. She was also a student of a religious school and was living in a monastery (with nuns) here in Hungary. She had very little technical knowledge in tango, but she was dancing with great enthusiasm. My kudos to her teachers in Colorado! :) 

BTW: she was very fond of modern/alternative tango, tango fusion dancing (tango + swing and/or salsa) and was obviously not trained with authenticity in mind. She was a living proof that it is possible to teach someone the love of dancing, an intimate embrace (I believe her religious background would not entirely prepared her for that), the love of music without even mentioning authentic cultural habits, forcing technique or sets of steps.

Nevertheless, teaching the (quality) embrace is an issue and I would be very happy if any of you could share some methods/exercises to make people aware of the right embrace.

Cheers,
Aron

With the music I described (Calo, Di Sarli, some Troilo, some Tanturi),
which does not have the constant drive of, for example (almost all)
D'arienzo [exception: El Cachafaz], there are moments available for pauses,
extended suspensions. This is part of the dance. However, the pause is only
for a few seconds and carefully spaced throughout the dance to match the
phrasing of the music. The rest of the time (most of the time) you move ...
and still feel this intense connection.

Steve,

Thanks for taking the time to reply to me.  I think I understand what you are refering to.  When discussing tango with my wife, I have been refering to this as either the geomtric or analytical aspect of the dance.  There are lots of way to model things, and your model makes as much sense as anything I've heard thus far, and it appeals to the analytical side of my personality (although I'm a beginner so my thoughts probably don't mean very much).  

For me, the hardest thing about understanding Tango has been the leads.  Most teachers I've encountered (thus far) are good at teaching steps, but not good at communicating how to lead the steps.  I still haven't really figured out if leading is more of a science (technical) or an art (but it seems like there should be a way to explain/teach this without taking a year).  For me that's the biggest problem I have with tango.  

If someone could come up with a model for how to lead, they'd get a lot more men to stick with it.

Regards,

David

Dear Steve (& list),

I spent 6 years learning the Pugliese system from instructors who had
studied with him (and had a brief opportunity to study with Mingo & Ester
myself), so I am familiar with the well-thought out system he has
identified. The last 3 years my tango studies have switched to milonguero
style tango. I will refer here in particular to turns.

The grapevine (forward - side - back - side) exists in both open and close
embrace styles.  However, in tango milonguero, it is not used as much as
'rock step turns' - clockwise and counterclockwise turns that achieve
turning through rotating rock steps.

Aside:
- For those who are not familiar with the tango milonguero repertoire, this
includes a variety of options for turning, including the familiar 'la
cunita', but more commonly used are 'rock & return' sequences which result
in the woman returning to a closed (feet) position or cruzada in front of
the man after a rock back and forward (or side out and back). These rock
steps can be varied in orientation, degree of rotation (no turn up to half
turns) and in rhythm ('slow' & 'quick' rocks) to provide a variety of
options for dancers. The ocho cortado is part of this family of sequences.
(We teach these in a course we call 'Rock around the clock')

The rock step turns are part of the core repertoire of tango milonguero, yet
these patterns are rare or non-existent in open embrace styles. I don't know
if anyone has codifed this rock-step system, but it does constitute a core
part of the 'structure of the dance' in tango milonguero.

 Hi Aron,

 This one is easy and I've learned it from lots of direct experience. Firstly, I wouldn't even try to "teach" a woman how to
 embrace a man - the fact is she already knows how to do it and if I try to "teach" it, she'll just get embarassed. Instead,
 towards the end of an 8-week beginner course, I'll dance with her. I won't tell her what I'm doing, I'll just embrace her and
 dance. In almost every case, the close embrace comes naturally. Of course, it's easy for me because I'm her teacher and she
 trusts me completely. Maybe at that time, she still can't do it with another man but at least she knows the feeling. Teaching the
 guys to dance close is a whole different thing and much more difficult. I would also add that, during our classes, my partner
 and I always demostrate the figures in close embrace, but we tell our students they don't have to do it that way until they feel
 comfortable. We then also demonstrate it in open embrace, which, to me, means 1 - 2 inches between the chests. Close
 embrace is contact at the chests. At the beginning, we also demonsrate with a 6-inch space at the chests and we
 tell them this is NOT Tango. 

 Another interesting thing, and this also applies to women who are not my students - after I've danced with them in close
 embrace, THAT'S ALL THEY WANT TO DO -  with me anyway :-). Women love close embrace and I don't understand why so
 many guys just don't get that.

Can any of our milongueras in BsAs comment on this - Janis, Deby? Maybe I misheard it, but
I'm sure I was told in BsAs that no self-respecting Milonguero would ever dance a rock-step. Of
course, I know Ocho Cortadas are used extensively but I don't think that'is what Ron is referring
to.

I don't have problem with guys showing women new steps. 
Some guys are good, some aren't.  That's just a fact of
life.

Beginners are constantly lamenting the difficulties of
working with each other in beginner-level classes.

My statement come from comments I hear all the time from
beginners and intermediate women ("He's not that good.  I
thought he was last year, but I was a beginner then.")  In
places like DC or NYC, you may have enough good role models
for beginners to see and emulate.  A lot of places don't
have that.

It's very easy for inexperienced dancers to be impressed
with flash, both men and women.  Heck, calling oneself a
"teacher" even sets it someone up as being more
knowledgable than a non-teacher, though we all know that is
not always the case.  

We've had problems here with both of those issues.  In the
case of "flash", the guy also happened to be very handsome
and the girls developed crushes on him.  You'd see him
dancing with a less experienced woman doing the talking
tango, and even putting his hand on her tailbone to get her
to do an ocho.  Yet, so many people thought this guy was
such a good dancer!  Now that he's finally left the area
(he's in your neck of the woods now!), we're finally
getting rid of the bad habits he instilled in a lot of the
women.  

But basically, many beginning women are happy to be asked
with danced by anybody.  They also tend to assume that if
they miss a step that it is their fault and may not be able
to recognize that it was a mislead.  I know that from
personal experience.

BTW, women are less willing to talk about guys in mixed
company, so I'm not surprised if you're not privy to those
conversations.

Indeed it would... if tango had any such structure. It doesn't. It can't, 
because it's not a symbolic language.

Sure. Here's the translation of Gustavo's basis for structural analysis:

 1) Sentences can be broken down into words.
 2) We've given names (symbols) to those words.

This is an attempt to create a symbolic language to represent the dance. 
In my opinion the best it can do is misrepresent. This makes it useless...

Steve has put himself in an interesting place ;) but I think there may be 
merit in principle in the idea of layers of tango learning, so I'm looking 
forward to his further explanation. 

> All he can do is refer to other teachers and make a list of some of the

Steve's Layer 3 has a little more than that. To find it, take out all the 
steps (as one must, since Steve includes those in Layer 4) and one is left 
(correct me if I am wrong, Steve) with what he's proposing as the Structure.

For example, that ochos are a sub-class of turns. So Steve, I'd like to 
hear a) why you think ochos are /necessarily/ a sub-class of turns b) and 
how this is useful to learning.

Agreed.

...or to start teaching Gustavo-style advanced seminars ;)

Hi Keith,

You're not the only one making broad generalizations around this topic 
(pun intended), but I wonder why the bad habit has persisted.

I mostly dance close when I'm out socially, but I've had several women 
ask me to dance open & lead more elaborate figures. I mean women who are 
fantastic in a close embrace. (They're good open too.)

To say that "women want this" or "women want that" is bizarre, in my 
view, even if it's a woman making the claim. We treat women as 
individuals when we dance... so why do we write of them as ciphers? Some 
women love dancing open and do it well. In fact, I'd say that in my own 
observation, 3/4 of hard-line close dancers (who dogmatically oppose 
dancing open) are men, not women. And I'm talking about long-term 
community members.

All these generalizations do is close doors for people, especially 
people now learning. Those of us who are teachers ought to be more 
responsible with our language than to dictate preferences, no?

since we both agree that the "traditional" way of
teaching tango has created more damage that good.

this is just not true.

1) Extracting a quote out of its context, especially
when it is but an example, makes it sound like
gobbledygook; but even from this quote, it is evident
she is talking about turning the shoulders: be your
ouwn guinea-pig & try it for yourself. If you only
turn the shoulders, keeping the chest immobile, you
will not feel any tension below it, only around the
back of the upper spine. Now try turning the ribcage
as well and you will feel contractions of the
abdominals.
2) The paragraph you have taken the quote from makes
it clear that she is only discussing "rotation
provided by extensor muscles" i.e. muscles at the back
of the spine. The abdominals are flexor muscles. The
previous, as well as the following paragraph
specifically mention the obliques involved in rotation
of the spine; furthermore, the table [10.1 Muscles of
the torso] on the following page lists both obliques
as being involved in rotation [well, I've got the
second [1996] edition].
3) The obliques, being further away from the axis are
much more instrumental in the rotation of the trunk
that the erector muscles, which are much closer to the
spine, and therefore need more effort. The extensors
work on the Class 1 lever principle, where the
resistance arm is longer than the effort arm,
requiring therefore much effort to achieve very little
[as in rotating the shoulders only]. The flexors, on
the other hand are basically Class 2 levers, with the
resistance close to the axis [fulcrum], requiring
therefore much less effort.
[See Kinesiology, Lutgens & Hamilton, 1997, Brown &
Benchmark, or
http://www.spinalfitness.com/Demo/123%20effective%20lever%20arm%20course.pdf]

4) The rotation takes place in the thoracic & cervical
spine, not the lumbar part, due to the shape of the
articulating facets of the lumbar vertebrae [Fitt,
p67, or any basic anatomy handbook].

I have found Fitt often very illuminating over the
years, but you can't always take what she says for
Gospel. What concerns us most as tango dancers &
teachers is posture; she correctly debunks the turnout
[p62] but does not mention that with 95% of the
population it will lead to hyperlordosis [p.245] since
most common mortals cannot, & should not be forced to,
do a 180 degree turnout [the ambition of all ballet
beginners] leading eventually to damage to individual
vertebrae [p.72] & permanent misaligment of the spine.

The greatest problem with women's technique is that it
usually is taught by individuals whose rump is
screaming out for a saddle [usually the younger ones,
who put ballet in their CV, but obviously couldn't
last too long doing it]. Their student copy their
posture yes, by osmosis, eventually becoming cripples
themselves, leading not only to chronic low back pain,
but upsetting the communication within the couple. For

Dear list,

Here in Boulder, we're finishing up two weeks worth of working with Gustavo
Naveira and Giselle Anne, learning from them, sitting with tears in our eyes
watching them dance, listening to their music choices as DJ's, and sharing
the social dance floor with them to live tango music.

Chris, your statements referring to Gustavo Naveira, his ideas, his
teaching, and what he means by various concepts, are so comically at
variance with what we're experiencing here for ourselves that it sadly calls
into question the validity of anything you say.  I say "sadly" because it's
clear you care a lot about tango, and like many of us, have had some
powerful experiences and conclusions which you seem interested in sharing.

To be clear, I am referring to your statements without the ";)" smiley after
or in them, and thus those which you perhaps intend to be taken seriously.
If you just forgot the ";)", well OK, never mind - we infer from Dani that
you don't mean anything substantive by statements so labeled.

You're not the only frequent poster on the list with serious
misunderstandings about Gustavo - just currently the most vociferous.

Assuming you DO have serious conversation to share here...for the record,
could you review for us just what your firsthand experiences with Gustavo's
teaching and dancing were?  Such a context would make your truly bizarre
statements a little easier to understand.

I concur with Steve that if anyone REALLY wants to know what Gustavo and
Giselle think/teach/dance, they should quickly see if there are any spots
left in Atlanta next week for his workshops and performances with Giselle.
G&G will be coming down from high altitude, so it should be incredible -
thinking about them having the extra oxygen in Atlanta makes me really happy
for all you easterners - they're altitude-adapted now, and they absolutely
blew the roof off last night.  People are saying they will remember it for
the rest of their lives.

Indeed it would... if tango had any such structure. It doesn't. It can't, 
because it's not a symbolic language.

Sure. Here's the translation of Gustavo's basis for structural analysis:

 1) Sentences can be broken down into words.
 2) We've given names (symbols) to those words.

This is an attempt to create a symbolic language to represent the dance. 
In my opinion the best it can do is misrepresent. This makes it useless...

Steve has put himself in an interesting place ;) but I think there may be

forward to his further explanation.

Steve's Layer 3 has a little more than that. To find it, take out all the 
steps (as one must, since Steve includes those in Layer 4) and one is left 
(correct me if I am wrong, Steve) with what he's proposing as the Structure.

For example, that ochos are a sub-class of turns. So Steve, I'd like to 
hear a) why you think ochos are /necessarily/ a sub-class of turns b) and 
how this is useful to learning.

Hi Andrew,

Thanks for the posting.  To be honest, I've put this topic
on the back burner until I can check with the local gurus,
who have been unavailable to me.  I'll look into your
analysis more.  But here are a few things.

I don?t believe she is talking about only turning the
shoulders.  She uses this example in a discussion about
torso muscles, not about the arm structure.  Your example
is more about arm structure movement, not torso rotation.

She mentions the abdominals in an example about a
left-twisting sit-up, which we don?t do in tango.  So I
found that example is to be too muddy to be used in a
discussion about ochos.  Konstantin?s argument about
obliques being the prime mover of rotation is what I
consider to be the point of discussion.  She also makes a
point of movement always starting from the center of the
body (more on that later).

Thanks for the source.  I?ll look more into that.

On that same page, she also says that other experts believe
otherwise, though such rotational movement is probably
minimal.  Our position is that in walking, the point of
where the thoracic and lumbar join is the joint where
rotation for walking should occurs for maximum efficiency.

But the big question is how does any of this relate to
teaching tango?  I believe this aspect of rotation got
started when Sean talked about movement coming from joints.
 There are a few reasons why we prefer to talk about bone
structure/joints than muscle structure in class, such as:

1.  Most people can?t actually feel what muscle they are
using anyway.   Tell someone to contract their obliques,
and they?ll probably end up contracting something else. 
However, having them focus on a bone and the joint allows
their brain to figure out on its own which muscles to use. 


2.  Even with people who know something about their
superficial muscles, such as the obliques, they may use
them in such a way that inhibits their deeper muscles to
move freely (more below).

3.  Bones can be felt with endpoints (joints) more easily
than muscles and muscle attachments.   It?s much easier to
show the rotation of the spine and actually see the
movement of the vertebraes than it is to show the
contraction of the obliques.  For the spine, I just need to
wear a fitted shirt, pull up my hair, and walk around so
folks can watch my back.  But I am not going to lift up my
shirt to show how I contract my obliques.  Even if I did, I
wouldn?t have much muscle definition to show anything,
anyway.

4.  Muscles, as Konstantin pointed out, only contract and
cannot stretch itself.  Yet we feel a stretch when we
dance, right?  We tell people to stretch this or stretch
that.  But when we stretch, we are obviously contracting a
muscle somewhere.  Figuring out what muscle to contract so
that another muscle can stretch is simply too
mind-boggling.  If people do contract a muscle, they often
have a difficult time releasing it.

In our work, we focus on REMOVING INHIBITORS to movement
instead of trying to force a movement.  We believe that it
is these inhibitors that make tango harder than it should
be to the average person.  The most common inhibitor is
tension in the superficial muscles (biceps, deltoids,
obliques, etc).  When these are not fully relaxed, they
limit the range of motion of deeper muscles and, thus,
limit the range of motion of the joints.  They act as
?containers? instead of ?expanders?.  In working with
people, we?ve found that the first thing they need to learn
is how to recognize tension and release their superficial
muscles.  An example is when a beginner first learns the
lapis, he usually tilts because he hasn?t learned to
separate his leg from his pelvis (his muscles aren?t
relaxed).

The latter method ends us creating stiff movements and
tension.  Ours is a longer term method but has worked
effectively in producing good dancers.  We also have a
movement expert that works hands-on with people.  It also
has the benefit of producing a positive learning
environment without the pressure to learn the hottest new
step.  Instead, dancers focus on what feels good and
compassion for other dancers.  It?s groovy, man. :)

Hi Keith,
I don't know perhaps exactly what you mean by "rock-step," but I can assure 
you that the milongueros here in Buenos Aires, when there is no space to 
advance on the pista, use something they might call "va y viene" to turn in a circle 
or just to keep dancing while not moving forward--just a little something in 
their repertoire that sometimes come in handy.

David,

You've hit upon a very important issue. In tango, next to learning how to 
move yourself, you (as the man) need to learn to impart your intention 
(lead) to the woman. This is one of the most difficult things to teach. It's 
probably not that your teachers are not good at communicating how to lead 
the steps. It's rather that it's very hard to make someone else feels what 
one feels when leading.It's a liitle bit like trying to describe a color to 
a person blind from birth. Or better yet trying to explain to somebody how 
to ride a bicycle.....

We've been teaching people to dance tango for nearly 15 years. Over this 
time I've tried all sorts of stratagems to impart the "leading" technique to 
beginning men dancers (and a few women as well). There is no single thing 
that will do the trick. Some guys seemingly learn by osmosis, some listen, 
watch and do it, some never quite get it. Sometimes "leading" the guys to 
move a step in a given direction will help them. I'm continually saying to 
the leaders to "lead the woman, make sure she's received the lead and then 
follow her". Really, the key to it is to recognize that the man is always 
following the woman after each lead he imparts to her.

The devil is in the details. How do you lead something? Is it with your 
hands? Is it with your chest?.... It is with the totality of your body, as 
you learn to move your body through space, you learn to move in a way that 
allows you to give your partner a direction and a subtle yet undeniable 
impulse to move where you need her to go. This lead comes from your core and 
it's transmitted through your arms and chest. The woman then takes this 
"lead" and transmits it from her hands and chest through her body to her 
legs and feet.... Then she moves and you move along with her to finish that 
step before you lead the next one. One thing is for sure, you never lead 
with your feet as in starting to step yourself in a given direction before 
the woman has begun to move.....  That usually results in  either the woman 
getting stepped on or being run over (or both). Once you've gotten a fair 
command of leading, your tango will take a huge leap forward in skill and 
enjoyment.

I think this is a pretty clear and accurate explanation of leading (and 
following). However, I doubt that it would do much  more good than whatever 
your teachers have said or done or tried to do in order to teach this.  This 
is just one of those things that must be experienced and integrated by each 
person...


Cheers,

Manuel

Based on my limited sample, I think that what many teachers of tango  
do is at best extremely inefficient for helping people become social  
tango dancers, and at worst counter-productive. And yes, this does  
include some big names.

OTOH, there are also many individuals who are successful at this  
goal. This seems to often  be because they see it as their primary  
goal - either because they are not driven by a commercial imperative,  
or because they see the building of a social tango community as being  
in their commercial interests.

I think that 'structure of the dance', as formal knowledge, is an  
optional layer, at least for dancers.  An analytical framework for  
codifying structure, and the resulting code, can be a very useful  
learning tool for some people, and has definitely led to a few people  
finding new possibilties.  However, it also seems quite clear that  
many good dancers - including older dancers in Daniel Trenners videos  
- do not have a structural framework.  They have no theory, they just  
do what they do. If asked why, they will say 'I don't know', or make  
something up. This does not mean that there is no structure to what  
they do, just that a formal understanding of that structure is not  
necessary to do it. (Or, you could say they have an intuitive or  
subconscious understanding, not a rational one.)

Classes that I have been to that use structural models as teaching  
aids definitely work for some people - they become more able to dance  
and improvise as a result.  But for most, it is an unnecessary and  
confusing extra layer of thinking.  And for followers, it has almost  
nothing to offer.

I think the idea that everyone will just learn by doing, without  
teaching,  is equally flawed, though it is true for a small minority  
of women.  I have seen it _not_  work plenty of times.  Having large  
numbers of people wanting to learn tango, from a starting base of a  
very small number of good dancers, is a difficult problem to solve.   
Those with the best aptitude will always learn anyway, but the great  
mass of us will not.   So, I am always keen to find different ideas  
as to what we can do in our tango community to have more people learn.

An analogy with language learning is perhaps illuminating:  small  
children learn to speak without much or any formal teaching, but with  
a large amount of exposure, demonstration, and correction.  Yet, very  
few adults can learn language like this, and we resort to having to  
formally  learn structure of the language - even for languages like  
English where the structures are famously inconsistent.

Tango teaching has come a long way in a few years, but has a long way  
to go.

Many are trying, and there are some successes.  Its great to hear  
about some of them on this list - it makes all the carping and nay- 
saying bearable!

Hi Jake,

A little problem here... I agree with "improving the damned men", but if you 
follow Chris' arguments, this is impossible. If I remember correctly, Chris 
argues, nay, rails  against all teachers and their teaching. How in  the 
hell is anyone going to improve the damned men?

BTW, people should know. I've watched you dance and heard you DJ and I 
definitely give you kudos and credibility. I think that many people can 
become very confused and misled reading these forums. Specially if they are 
beginners or don't have good teachers or examples of tango nearby. Unlike 
yourself, many "experts" who expound erudite, can not dance their way out of 
a paper bag and have very little talent for teaching or DJing either. 
Although some words and writings might make sense to the cognoscenti, it 
does not mean they reflect the truth of the writers' dance floor creds.

Respectfully,

Manuel

PS I hope you make it to Atlanta again... (we are having a great 4 days of

Then Brian you should have no problem critiquing my:

......
Here's the translation of Gustavo's basis for structural analysis:

 1) Sentences can be broken down into words.
 2) We've given names (symbols) to those words.

This is an attempt to create a symbolic language to represent the dance. 
In my opinion the best it can do is misrepresent. This makes it useless...

Perhaps when you get a spare moment, you'd care to identify which part or 
parts of this are at variance with what you're experiencing, and how.

Well, I've felt this in:

* women whose have just been sitting at a milonga and have never done  
a class
* women whose have just been sitting at a practica and have never  
done a class
* women who have just watched a tango show
* women who saw tango on dance with stars or somesuch
* women who have been dancing with someone who muscles them around  
the floor
* women who have been dancing with someone whose lead is vague but  
expects them to do something anyway
* and women who have been doing step classes. And self-led boleo  
classes...
* oh, and men who usually lead

Its normal. Followers want to make the dance work. They see  
something, they try to copy it.  For some things this works fine.   
For the core skills of tango, it doesn't work much.

I think you might be suffering from confirmation bias -- which is  
sadly what many teachers of sequence classes also seem to suffer  
from. Sequence classes as the main form of learning are ineffective.  
But you way overstate the case here.

Ability to dance tango is not innate, though it draws on skills which  
are innate for many people.  The problem is to find ways of learning  
which work with these skills rather than against them.

It sure is. One wouldn't expect anyone to learn to ride a bike through 
explanation rather than direct experience of riding, so why would one 
expect different for tango?

Not enough. It's with the totality of your body and hers too.

Trini et al,

The problem with all such anatomical discussions as tools for tango 
instruction is that no dancer is moving as a solo entity when they're in 
the embrace. Even if a woman starts dancing by herself, what she does 
has consequences for her partner.

The mechanics of body movement in the embrace aren't the same as in solo 
movement.

I'm not saying that there's no insight in what you're looking at. But 
don't put too much stock in it. A woman's torso might rotate without her 
using _any_ muscles at all, if I'm her partner and I decide it will be 
that way. And to make that happen, I might only use muscles in my legs.

Well when I learned to rock and roll 1000s of years ago we were taught a 
rock step.  In tango? Hmmm....well none of the milongueros I have ever 
danced with ever did any rock step stuff with me.  But then I am blond 
so maybe I just didn't notice....I have never been rocked stepped to 
return to a closed position of the feet.  To be honest Ron, reading your 
post I was trying to figure out just what is being danced.  It sounds a 
little complicated.    The only thing I can think you are thinking of is 
the giro.  Giros should be smooth.  There is no rock steps.  They just 
go.  When done correctly, there may be a slight pause for the woman.  I 
have my own style where I am suspended on the side movement on one leg 
(don't try this at home....). Could you be confusing a back step to the 
music as a rock step?

On another note Janis and I were at Celia's together tonight.  We were 
talking about this rock step thing. Neither one of us knew what it was. 
Then she danced with a man.  When she came back to the table she went 
"He rock stepped me!!"  It was a unique experience.  So I guess I would 
have to stay, rock stepping with the milongueros I dance with is not a 
core structure of the dance.  Who is coming up with these words "core 
structure?"  God, it sounds like a positional paper for a management 
consultant not people who are supposed to be enjoying dancing.

Keith is right. Please don't get hung up on terminology. The rock step he is 
talking about is the "arrepentida" or corte. It's the most basic and 
necessary steps to dance close embrace. I guess some might call it "va y 
ven", but I think that is the "cadencia" or as somebody posted "Gardelito". 
They are similar steps but the timing is completely different. I'm sure all 
you expat ladies in BAires do it all the time, many times in every tango you 
dance. It's the best way to navigate the crowded floors If you don't do 
turns.

One of the most successful tango intro sessions I have seen was at a  
'men's dance festival'.  Most of the participants at the festival  
were kids, but there was also a bunch of adults, mostly their parents.

This class was all men, maybe about one third gay, the kids were all  
busy doing hiphop and ballet --  I'm not sure which of these made the  
difference.  The whole atmosphere in the workshop was enormously less  
fraught than the typical mixed tango intro class, even though many of  
the men were not dance-interested -- they were mostly 'just' dads of  
boys who were into dance, looking for something to do while their  
kids were doing classes.

In 90 minutes, we got further than many mixed classes do after 3 or 4  
sessions.

But, I find it enormously difficult to convince men of the value of  
practising with other men - let alone attending men-only classes or  
practices, or the extreme of attending a men-only intro session.  The  
closest most will come is them dancing with a woman, and me next to  
them, body to body, and leading them to lead the woman -- with this,  
they at least get some sense of what the woman might feel like when  
he leads her, and the quality of movement this needs from him.

So, anyone with ideas as to how to get this to happen - for new men,  
not those already dancing?

Having women learn tango, at a beginner level, is relatively easy  
once you have enough good leaders who are willing to help (or 'dance  
with bad dancers' as some would put it).   But with men, its a  
different kettle of fish.

Agreed. And no-one in this debate has suggested otherwise.

Many adults /can/... if they give it as much time and attention as does the 
child. Their problem is won't, not can't. Likewise in tango learning.

Hence the attraction of the class route, presenting tango as a pattern 
dance. If people understood that learning it was more like learning an 
instrument, then the learning success rate would be much higher.

But of course the teaching income would be far lower. Economic natural 
selection favours teachers who present tango as a pattern dance... 
to beginners through prescriptive steps, right up to so-called 
advanced through this so-called structural analysis / tango grammar.

More nonsense. E.g. see my Tango-L message http://tinyurl.com/24rku7 .

Well, you could find the teachers Tete was referring to when he said: 
"There are only between 5-10 tango teachers that can really teach you how 
to dance tango." http://tinyurl.com/2f99up

Or you could try something else. ;)

Deby,

I believe we have a confusion about terminology.

When I was going to Marta Fama's group class in Palermo on Wednesday 
night, she was teaching some milonga traspie stuff that looked awfully 
like what I learned as a "rockstep" here in the USA.  As Manuel says, 
it's also known to many as an "arrependita".

The rockstep (as I understand it) isn't a core piece of tango by 
itself, because the woman isn't being led to collect.

However, there's a important kernel of wisdom hidden here: a man 
needs a surprisingly small number of basic elements on his part to 
dance tango adequately.

This same number of basic elements is also all he needs to be a 
great dancer, if we believe the distance between adequacy and 
greatness is measured in terms of embrace, posture, technique, 
musicality and quality of movement as well as repertoire.

A good 50% of our country's populace supported England during that war, 
Jeff. You're quoting our propaganda, often passed off as "history" to 
people too young to know the difference between fact and assertion, and 
too preoccupied with other things to care.

Hardly.

People's politics here have always been full of posturing and hypocrisy. 
Read Richard Wright or Wyndham Lewis for numerous examples from that era 
("a few decades ago") in particular.

This point has been made by those critical of democracy (i.e., 
egalitarianism) as a _cultural_ value (and likewise of statistics, 
averages, etc.) for about two centuries now. Largely by artists.

The linchpin of free democracy (i.e., majority rule), of course, is 
individual and minority rights, which many people conveniently forget 
when they're making reductive generalizations about "egalitarianism." 
There have been quite impressive intellects (Leopardi, De Toqueville, 
etc.) who have criticized democracy as an institution of mediocrity-- 
and not without reason, except insofar as they overlook this rather 
important raison d'etre.

Which raison was, naturally, the privilege of the aristocratic ethos. 
Which itself spilled over into common life, until every common ass saw 
himself a "gentleman." See Lewis for more eloquent statements of this.
> Women want to be treated as the unique people they are. Men want a women that makes the world stop for them. So, in tango I agree that the normal American egalitarian ideas tend to go against the grain.
Your "America" is too much Norman Rockwell & Garrison Keillor, and not 
enough Emerson/Whitman/Thoreau, my man. The rugged individualism and 
self-reliance of our culture, like its (conflicted) Puritan aspect, are 
easily more definitive than these courtroom cartoons, which our history 
has ground underfoot repeatedly anyway.

Furthermore, a substantial (and shallow) part of American culture, 
especially among the bourgeoisie, consists of affectation and 
anti-populist gestures, and always will. Hence the propensity of rich 
kids to take (status) French courses in high school, while poor kids 
enroll in (practical) Spanish courses. (I'm now 30: this is COMMON 
knowledge in my generation.) Thus also the prevalence of Oscar Wilde 
quotes among us, and the relative neglect of his infinitely superior 
contemporary Mark Twain (whom Europeans appear to appreciate more than 
we do, nowadays, and whom we often consider a bigger redneck than he 
was, simply by identifying him with his more famous subject matter). 
(But this is the reader's chief fallacy with any author.)

Short version: Your portrait of America could use a few more postcards. 
You're talking about the country of Dickinson, Barnum, Edison, Welles, 
Groucho, Elvis, Jimi... The America you invoke, if only to discard, 
barely exists in the first place, except as a scarecrow in bad editorials.

Milonga traspie is not the same as tango.  It is danced well as an added 
step with a changing of weight rapidly between the beats.  One must move 
faster to allow that extra jig.  The reason most cannot do it well is 
because they do "hop" or rock step to get to the next step.  That is the 
main reason why I seldom dance milonga.  I feel like I am doing the la 
quebradita.  There are very few teachers who can teach milonga traspie 
well.   The majority in my experience teach it as a hop or a rock step 
and that goes for Argentines as well as anyone else.

In the ocho cortado, the giro, there is no rock step.  There is a shift 
of weight on the woman (or as you guys like to neutralize - the 
follower).  In the ocho cortado that keeps on going - back and forth 
between feet,  the weight is shifted back and forth to each foot.  The 
difference between it looking sassy and looking clumsy is the ability of 
the step to be well followed as change of weight.   The change of weight 
from the woman is NOT a rock step.  It is a slight movement.  In the 
giro it comes across as a hesitation.  This also comes from the changing 
of weight. 

When I watch people dance from wherever they may come, I see this 
rock-step action.  Please don't slam for this, but it is usually from 
foreign dancers who have not been taught how to subtlety lead and follow 
this step.  They have been taught it as a rock step.  This is probably 
what Keith from HK meant when he said it is not danced here.  You don't 
see an exaggerated rock step here unless it is with people who are just 
learning or do not dance well, and even then you don't see it that much.

Perhaps this is all just silly semantics.  For me a rock step from my 
era....was a much harder based step.  Nothing elegant about it.  A giro, 
an ocho cortado, and whatever other "steps" you want to call them should 
be elegant.

Techniques for learning to lead can be embedded in the teaching of steps 
patterns or structure.  They are sometimes left to special classes in 
technique.  They should be integrated into instruction, but many teachers, 
particularly those who concentrate on teaching step patterns, rely on 
osmosis for their students to learn to lead.

For myself, I have found the best way for me to learn how to lead any 
specific move is to fully understand the woman's elements.  For that 
reason, I always get frustrated in the typical class where the instructors 
show the step together and then divide the class into two parts--one for 
the men's step patterns and one for the women's step pattern.  I want to 
understand the woman's part.  Once I understand that, I can lead it.  Once 
I can lead her movements, my own footwork follows.

Developing leading skills in classes on structure can be particularly 
useful because leading skills are general to the movements.

I think you have to bring back the masculinity of the dance. That you can practice Tango without having all that sensuality (male female connection.) 

I get this all the time when I take lessons and there are not enough girls. I do hate it when four guys end up dancing by themselves due to their aversion to dancing with another man. 

The best way I have seen it encouraged is when during practise the men and women are split to go over detailed moves. The teacher will take a guy and lead the move for us to see. It all depends on the approach, if the teacher does this in a masculine way, say in terms of more direct and less "gentle hands" the students get used to seeing this done. 

I mentioned this before in a previous post about how taken I was when watching Godoy's "Tango Emocion" and the men only scene. 

The problem is the stereotype of ballroom dancing. That it is all a bit "showy" and men with men just look, well a bit "showy." It is perception, if you as teachers can show that men are allowed to be men, and encouraged to be strong, "aggressive" and masculine then I see men taking the time to learn with other men.

side note:
I am busy looking around for a male only couple I found the other day on the web. I have lost the bookmark but these guys were amazing to watch. Very inspiring!

Subject: [Tango-L] Structure of Tango
Message-ID: <20070723150207.4567A95F80@p1fed1.frb.org>

Hi Everyone:

I agree with Jake Spatz that if we  think of tango dancing as being made 
up of individual steps and sequences of steps (step patterns), the 
structure is not these steps and patterns.  The structure is the fabric 
from which these movements are created.  Structure can be discerned 
through the examination of step possibilities.  But, I also wouldn't 
regard the systematic examination of step possibilities as being the 
structure.  Rather, that is the theory through which structure is 
described.  Why is it only theory?  The systematic examination of step 
possibilites is thoughts about the dance that can be confirmed or refuted 
by an examination of its elements and not the fabric from which the 
movements are created.  Such an examination cannot be used as dance 
itself.

I think it is quite reasonable to point out as Gary Barnes has done that 
many dancers learn without studying the theory of the structure, but such 
an observation may be beside the point.  As Gary points out, a structure 
underlies what the older dancers do and they "have an intuitive or 
subconscious understanding [of tango's structure], not a rational one." 
The idea is that studying the structure of tango is a quicker means of 
learning the knowledge that the dancers of an older generation took 25+ 
years to master intuitively.

I should be clear that I'm not proposing studying structure in a book as a 
formal knowledge as an end in itself.  One has to develop the intuitive or 
subconcious feel for the movements, and the only way to do so is by 
dancing.  The idea is to use the conscious mind to help train the 
intuitive mind for dancing.

Edgar Degas said, "Only when he no longer knows what he is doing does the 
painter do good things."
Charlie Parker said, "Learn the changes and then forget them."

With best regards,
Steve

Ok, now that I know I was wrong in my defence of what I thought to be your playing devil's advocate, here we go...

>Here's the translation of Gustavo's basis for structural analysis:
>1) Sentences can be broken down into words.

You have an irritating and nonsensical habit of taking 'quotations' out of context and twisting the meaning to suit your own needs. This is not "an attempt to create a symbolic language to represent the dance", it is an attempt (and a successful one at that) to convey the concept of his work to his students. There is no attempt to start a new language. It's all about interpretation and for a teacher, an innovator, to find ways of clarifying his ideas... making such concepts easier to convey. This is the teacher's (any teacher) job... to find new ways of conveying concepts. What's wrong with that?! The simple fact is that his method works.

You know, one of the things that pisses me off about this List are the eejits, the armchair 'critics' who openly attempt to destructively criticise world-class teachers (and by world-class I mean those subject to international 'limelight'). There is too much of this on this List. How would you (any of you offenders) like to be publicly condemned?

On the other hand, Brian, as much as I thoroughly agree with you about Gustavo, I have to say the following to you:
I get annoyed about peoples' ideas, which often flies in the face of the natural concept of what tango (in fact, almost any partnered dance but more so tango), in my opinion is... machismo vs femininity. The man is the predator, the woman is the prey, as has been since time immemorial (which is undoubtedly the reason why seeing women leading irritates me so much). To hear what should be a machismo tanguero talking of "sitting with tears in our eyes watching them dance" really turns my stomach. Men (even more so in the tango world) should be men... not wimps (American equivalent, I believe, is "wussy" or something).

Anyway, Chris, it's obvious you have never taken any classes/courses with Gustavo. This has to be the case as you have to have come to a cockeyed analysis probably having formulated your ideas from 3rd and 4th-hand twaddle. I have taken workshops, classes, festivals with many, many teachers worldwide over a ten-year period, and I have been on three week-long seminarios with Gustavo and Giselle-Anne to date. My conclusion? Gustavo is THE best. I saw Gustavo and Giselle-Anne performing at the recent Roma Tangocamp and although I did not (sorry, Brian) 'sit with tears in my eyes watching them dance' (yeccchhhh)... they were mind-blowing! It was the best I'd ever seen them.

I've been to many tango (and other) events and always get irritated about how people go over the top and give standing ovations for absolutely any performance regardless; it's as if (like giving tips in restaurants) it's become the expected thing to do, almost a custom. Well, unless it's for Sinatra or someone (or some performance) of that stature, I'm not one for standing ovations. As I said, it as seems to be the wont of so many people these days and for the least little thing. Hoewever, at Tangocamp in Rome, Gustavo and Giselle-Anne, these two, did indeed deserve exactly that.

Chris, come down off your 'high horse', go on one of Gustavo's seminarios and experience the best.

Very best wishes

Exactly! And vice versa.  So with this understanding, one
can influence your partner's movements, regardless of
whether they are aware of the mechanics.

A couple of months ago at a milonga, I asked a friend of
mine to dance.  He initially declined, saying that he
hadn't been dancing well that night.  I talked him into it,
anyway, and when we embraced I immediately noticed that his
back was stiff, which meant that he had limited mobility. 
By exaggerating my own spinal movement more, I was able to
induce his spinal movement and free up the rest of his body
to move.  We had a terrific tanda.  Afterwards, he said,
"Trini, what did you do to me?".  He was so glad he had
agreed to dance.  I just smiled.  He had driven two hours
to get here.  I couldn't let him leave for home without
making sure he had a good dance.

It's also a simple technique I use to encourage novice men
to get out on the dance floor before they take a single
lesson.  All they need is the confidence that they can move
and a sense of freedom.  I just ask them to walk with me a
little bit.  Before you know it, they're trying changes of
front and turns as they are navigating along the dance
floor.  (Out of curiosity, Jake, what do you do when a man
visits a milonga to see what tango is like?  How do you
encourage him to try it?)

For leading, a man can use this rotation to get the woman
to extend her leg backwards without shifting his weight
forward.  A couple of my favorite partners can move my
right arm to induce me to do a back cross/ocho.  They do
not do any torsion themselves (only a arm structure
movement), but it still affects my spinal movement.  As a
follower, I just need to remember to keep my arm loose for
these guys, whereas I usually tense up more for a man who
uses my arm randomly.

Steve was using "mastery" to mean either "promise" or "basic

If _this_ is even "basic competence," let alone mastery of anything, I

The "rock step" is normally used to turn left; it can be used in other ways 
as well.

Some old milngueros may call it "Gardelitos". The name rock step comes from 
ballroom dancing where it is used in the same way.

The turn using  "Gardelitos" (rock step) imay be as follows:

You walk the lady to step #4 of the base.  Here the lady has her feet 
aligned rt. back and left front. Your feet are aligned Lt. front rt. back.

In this position you bring the lady even closer to your chest and start 
rocking between the two feet,
moving slightly to rotate to your left.

This step is used mostly in Canyengue style and also in Milonga but can also 
be used in tango.

It is a very simple way to turn but it has to be done with certain presence, 
demeanor and personality.

Regards, Sergio

You know, this is all about terminology, and it's a bit ridiculous especially 
because of the two languages, English and Spanish, in which we learn and 
dance tango. (OK, in Finland maybe there's three.)

But anyway. the "arrependita" of Christopher is probably what my partner 
Ruben Aybar calls what I call, "ocho cortado" (still with me here?) Some people 
also call it a "milonguero cross" but believe me, no milonguero uses that term.

A "rock step" to me is when the feet don't change position (one is forward, 
one is back), but the weight "rocks" forward and back, and milongueros often 
use it as a turn.

Because tango is a walking dance, there are times when the walk has to be in 
place, and very simply "rocks" forward and back, changing feet, changing 
weight--no hip motion, no fancy stuff, no rock 'n roll.

No big deal. Not even sure why I replied to this post. A rose by any other 
name...

I love dancing milonga.  It is a joy.  In keeping with the idea of it just 
being a romp, I tend to stick to basic milonga ste[s, adding a few traspie 
movements only when I am comfortable with a partner and the music seems to 
ask for traspie.

What I observe when watching others dancing milonga with lots of traspie 
elements, is that many dancers rush their double-time movements.  The 
result is a lot of hoppping.

About the use of the rock-step in milonguero-style tango:
Susana Miller teaches what I would describe as a giro if you are watching 
what the woman is doing.  As Susana teaches the step pattern, the man's 
footwork gives him an appearance and feeling of doing a rock step. 
Interestingly enough, I have found there are at least three different 
options for the man's footwork on this giro--one of which is a single foot 
spin which gives the man a very different appearance and feel.

With best regards,
Steve

If you want to stay with the bicycle analogy, I recall years back (when teaching my son how to ride a bicycle), explaining things to him was far more effective than having him watch me ride a bike.  It also didn't take months for him to figure it out.

This would lead me to conclude that either properly explaning things is useful, or comparing tango to riding a bike is not a good analogy.

Hey, Dani, relax.  I agree with you about men and women in some ways that

by watching my wife Deb ruin her makeup.  

On the other hand, I seem to recall lots of tough Italian guys in the
"Godfather"-vein of our popular mythology who let themselves go emotionally
at an opera, for example.  In these popular portrayals, these guys seem like
fellows that I wouldn't want to call a wimp, except maybe over a phone from
an untraceable location. I'd say context is important in evaluating whether
tears convey strong passionate emotion or "wussy-hood".

In any case, I wish I'd been there in Rome with you!

This statement has no evidence to back it up.  I've heard some 
people who know diddly about teaching tango (and indeed diddly 
about the dance), say that beginners need to learn steps to feel 
like they have something worthwhile.  

However, the universe is full of step merchants barely able to 
pay for their studio, teaching classes of 8 to 12 beginners and 
4 to 6 intermediates, having to find new students all the time, 
etc.

What I think:

Outside of being a name brand (Fabian, Gustavo, Chicho, Pablo,
Julio and a few others), what makes a teacher economically 
viable is how much fun his or her students have in classes.  
No other criteria deserve mention.  For that matter, I'm sure
that name brand or no, people who can't put a smile on their 
student's faces aren't going to remain a name brand for long.

So at one extreme, you have people like Fernanda Ghi and 
Guillermo Merlo, and at the other extreme you have your 
Brigitte Winklers and Thomas Howlins of the world.  They're 
all a lot of fun and they all do fairly well.

That being said, I see a significant movement among some of 
the people organizing the larger festivals in the US (like 
the ones in Atlanta and Denver) to bring on teachers who 
don't teach steps per se.  Rather, they intend to equip 
students with the tools needed to do anything their bodies 
might need to do in the dance, up to and including a good 
appreciation of the music, along with the the ability to 
respond to it in a way that's both emotional and disciplined.

And before we get all uppity at the step merchants, it's 
also clear to me that once you have embedded the basics of 
tango movement in your muscle memory, they are extremely 
valuable for showing you all kinds of cool things that you 
never thought of.  There's always a place in the world for 
a some of those.

The two things in common about every Very Good male dancer I know:
    -- They know the value of dancing with another dude
    -- They've taken notes (even if they've discarded them)

If you actually care about helping make better dancers, you'd naturally 
be infuriated at men, straight or gay, who are too insecure to dance 
with each other, in order to improve. You need tips on persuading them? 
Just give a damn, and let them know it.

And if they aren't convinced, tell them to take a hike. If you can't do 
that, don't even bother _trying_ to persuade them. Find a man who can do 
the job.

Or, just point (and laugh) at the men who walk like Susana Miller.

Hope that helps, brash as it is.

Guys,

   An alternative to dancing with men is to insist
that the followers do not back-lead.  Too many women,
having been shown the steps they are expected to
produce, do them without getting a lead and fool the
leader into believing that he has made it happen. 
Thus, we get the 'automatic' cross or the never-ending
ochos going in  every beginner class.  When I have
been asked to partner a beginner, I never move until I
get the lead and they quickly figure out how to make
that happen.  If they try to force a movement with
their hands, I drop my hand from theirs.  If they give
me a verbal lead, I smile and stand my ground.  Maybe
this is why men as followers worked?  Because the men
would not/could not anticipate the lead and would not
be pushed around?

  Let us not forget that the highest compliment one
can bestow upon a follower is that "she waits well."

Nancy

Christopher (& list),

I apologize for confusion about terminology. I'm not sure where I first
picked up this term. What I can 'rock steps' Robert Hauk calls 'check steps'
to desinate the incomplete weight transfer.

I think most people are familiar with 'la cunita', which I believe has also
been referred to on occasion as 'la hamaca', which does not result, as you
say, in the woman being led to collect.

This is part of a larger family of 'steps' in which leading the woman to
collect after 'rocking' is included; in fact, the collecting steps comprise
a greater proportion of this family. For example, the man can step forward
with the left foot resulting in a incomplete transfer of weight, followed by
an incomplete transfer of weight to the back (right foot), followed by
bringing the woman to collect by leading her to step forward on the right
foot and now make a complete weight change. The angle of orientation of this
'rock step' can change, clockwise or counterclockwise.

With regard to weight transfer, as Deby says, less is better. (Perhaps this
is why 'rock' step  is a poor term that, for better or worse, is widespread
in the English speaking tango world. I'd be happy to substitute a better
term.)

The most familiar named sequence in this family is the 'ocho cortado', which
in itself has several common variations. The ocho cortado is a common
culmination of rock steps that rotate clockwise, followed by
counterclockwise movement into the cross.

Another named sequence in this family is the 'media vuelta', although this
term is perhaps too general (literally 'half turn') to be useful. In this
sequence the man steps movement outside partner right (woman back left),
crosses left behind right foot and rotates his chest to lead the women
forward right (back then forward constituting a 'rock'), then forward left,
with the continued rotation bringing the woman again inot the cross. This is
a conterclockwise turn.

There are numerous other sequence combinations that can incorporate various
components of these named 'steps'.



However, there's a important kernel of wisdom hidden here: a man

With reference to these rock step (or otherwise named) elements being part
of the 'core' repertoire of milonguero style tango, they join walks
(caminadas) and runs (corridas), forward and back ochos, and grapevine
turns. Probably that's more than a 'small number of basic elements', because
one can, of course, dance adequately/well with a subset of repertoire.


This same number of basic elements is also all he needs to be a

Dear Dani,

I think you are confusing, or conflating, being sensitive and
emotional (and not afraid to share it with others) with being weak(*),
inferring the latter from the former. This is faulty reasoning,
however, kind of asuming the outcome or a faulty mathematical
induction. If someone's in a weak position, they may cry, but the
opposite does not follow - that if someone cries, they are inherently
weak or wimpy.

With best regards,

Konstantin
Victoria, Canada

(*)Similarly, others in life regularly conflate being diplomatic or
nice or friendly or willing to compromise with being a wimp or weak.
Generally people are being nice or diplomatic by choice, however, not
out of weakness. BTW, women can probably write PhDs on that subject.

My 2 cents,

I will say that the structure of the dance as discussed previously allows 
dancers to become aware of the possibilities for movement. 

I have doubts about using the conscious mind to train the intuitive one, I 
think that what eventually happens is that the brain gets programmed gets 
programmed to remember, perform, and synchronize most difficult and seamless 
movements. 

The challenge in performing structured sets or permutations of movements' 
combinations as advocated by the structure of dance is that the dancers have to 
learn how to stitch movements.  

What appears to be advocated among some tango instructors of the structure of 
the dance is that if one train long and hard enough in trying movements' 
combinations it will convey to an audience the impression that one's dance is 
different and thought of being creative or improvisational.

What do I think is an improvisational dance?

I think the improvisational element in tango dance is an elusive one because to 
perform an improvisational dance, as supported information in this topic, the 
dancers must be willing to allow their bodies, not their minds, take control of 
the dance. To achieve such level in the improvisational sense is for the 
dancers to be willing to risk moving into performing loose movements for which 
dancers will not know how these loose movements are going to turn out.

Paraphrasing statements and winding down this topic

> "Only when he no longer knows what he is doing does the painter do good 
things."<
For me, it will be equivalent to allow my body to take control of the dance 
with the inherited risk that I may not know what comes up next, and eventually

Arrepentida is a smaller piece than that.  It's just a change of
direction that happens before the weight is transferred.  And it
needs a bit of fold, spindle and mutilate to make it into an ocho
cortado.

My Argentine dancepartner called the rock step (with or without turn) a "rebota". A word I hadn't heard before. (She did not speak a word of English or taken lessons from teachers who usually teach non-spanish speakers). She also believed that it should be used only when really needed (to avoid immediate collision, to quickly change direction or as a game with the rythm  la traspie)

This only true if one accepts the notion that education in tango is an 
either or proposition.  Rather than proposing that instruction consist 
soley of small rhythmic movements, refinement in the quality of movement, 
the structure of tango or step patterns, I am saying that a complete 
eduction includes all four elements.

Chris (UK) said that tango instruction ought to be similar to music 
instruction.  Those who learn to play jazz study and practice rhythmic 
elements, they work to refine their sound, they study music theory and 
practice playing scales and arpeggios (the music counterpart to studying 
structure)l, and they study and play the compositions and solos of the 
great jazz players.  Can someone successfully make the transition from 
aspiring jazz musician to accomplished jazz musician by pursuing only one 
of these four elements?  Possibly if it is the fourth element, but why 
would one choose to take such a limited approach to learning or accept 
such a limited approach from one's instructor?

With best regards,
Steve (de Tejas)

Message-ID: <BAY105-F23C79C1B5AD2DCA5F5F7CA97F70@phx.gbl>

"Rebote"   means bounce - to spring back from a surface in a lively manner.

"Arrepentida"  means that you were going to execute some step but you 
changed your mind and returned or changed direction.


In Rocking steps : you keep the feet in the same position and change your 
weight from one to the other, with or without turn.   It is as if you bounce 
from one foot to the other (Rebote).  Usually you may do more thatn one in a 
row.

In Arrepentida you do the same movement but only once, usually with the 
object of changing the direction of your displacement.

Sergio

I stand corrected. You are both perfectly correct. There is no shame nor wussiness/wimpishness in tough guys shedding a tear or two... in fact, I myself have done so many times. I suppose it's my southern Italian heritage coupled with an inherent deep sensitivity... in fact, the latter is very much an innate characteristic of the former!

My focus was muddled by the 'horrendous-squared' image I often get of the contrived nonsense and artificialness/falseness of (particularly) non-latins trying to be 'quasi-latins' (particularly trying to be Argentine-latin). We've all seen them giving the kiss on the cheek(s) when it's *not inherent in their own culture*... ie they do it just because they've started tango. You know the type... there are loads of these pretentious twats where I am. In fact, many of them actually get it wrong. They try to be Argentinean while they mete out a bilateral cheek kiss with an obvious "mmwwwuuuuhhh, mmwwwuuuuhhh" when in fact they are ignorant of the fact that in Argentina it's ONE kiss; they're entirely oblivious to the fact they're actually inadvertently trying to be Italian...! >:-))))))) This pretentiousness kills me! I simply had the image of an extrapolation of the kissing thing into "sitting there with tears in our eyes"...

Anyway, enough of my griping.

Brian, you also asserted:
>In any case, I wish I'd been there in Rome with you!
Sorry to disappoint you but, being the macho hunk I am, I would have refused your offer to dance! >:-)))))

By the way, 'Chris(UK)' sleeps with the fishes.

Revote is rebound, as in firing a gun, or bouncing back.

Message-ID: <51794.1185256426@tangohk.com>

Hi Everybody,

I never expected such a prolonged discussion over such a simple thing as the Rock-Step. Whatever we call it, we all know it exists in Tango and it's one of the very first steps that beginners use in navigating around the floor. But the more we learn, the less the Rock-Step should be used. As Aron's partner says ... " it should be used only when really needed" or, to quote Janis from a private message that I hope she won't mind me using ... " Milongueros are more creative than rock steps."  The original point of the discussion was to question Ron's assertion that .. the rock-step system constitutes a core part of the 'structure of the dance' in tango milonguero." I think the replies have shown that it doesn't.

I still dance rock-steps because I teach and dance a lot with my beginners. But if I find myself doing one with an experienced follower, the thought that pops into my head is ... " Oh god, you moron - is that the best you can do - a boring rock step". If I can catch myself in time, I'll at least try to put a lot of turn on it - as Gavito teaches in his Video, Un Tal Gavito.

Keith,

It's admittedly peripheral to tango, but I thought Jeff's post needed a 
reply just for the record, this being an international forum. Point 
being: If we're going to talk about cultures, let's at least not be so 
lame about it.

Apologies for wasting your time.

Keith,

I'll remember never to send you a 'private' message.

The more dancers learn, the less prominent NON-turning rock steps become.
For some dancers, as they learn more steps, they stop walking.  Tango
instructors would go broke if  they taught walking technique.  They can live
off of tango if they teach 'cool steps'.

In the milonguero style, rock steps inititate the turning ocho cortado,
turns to the right and left with sacadas (grapevine turns), and various half
and full turns that do not follow the grapevine pattern. These become a
standard part of the milonguero style tango repertoire. They have a
functional use for crowded floors, less so for uncrowded floors. Dancers who
do not stay in the line of dance also do not need them.


The original point of the discussion was to question Ron's assertion that ..
> the rock-step system constitutes a core part of the 'structure of the dance'
> in tango milonguero." I think the replies have shown that it doesn't.



The original point of the discussion was in response to Stephen Brown's
description of the structure of the dance.

"The rock step turns are part of the core repertoire of tango milonguero,
yet these patterns are rare or non-existent in open embrace styles. I don't
know if anyone has codifed this rock-step system, but it does constitute a
core part of the 'structure of the dance' in tango milonguero."

Note the reference is to TURNS that incorporate the rock step. It was in
response to Steve's discussion of the Mingo Pugliese system.

Keith, you didn't understand the original post.  You took the term 'rock
step' out of context and blew it out of proportion.


I still dance rock-steps because I teach and dance a lot with my beginners.

I hope the women I dance with don't think walking is boring and tell me they
want to be led to at least 20 boleos and 10 ganchos in a 3 minute tango,
along with all the volcadas and colgadas that are infecting US dance floors.
Connect with your partner and the music first and learn to navigate. A good
leader focuses on that rather than step vocabulary. If the woman enjoys the
dance, she won't report to her friends what steps the man did and did not
do. Turns are not performed because they are in the dancer's repertoire and
need to be exhibited to the audience to show the dancer's prowess. They are
used because of the navigational needs of the floor, out of respect for
other dancers.

Message-ID: <20070724144549.681A9235284@p3fed1.frb.org>

In discussing rock steps, I think Ron is quoting his own earlier post:

don't
>know if anyone has codifed this rock-step system, but it does constitute

I remain skeptical that there is an open-embrace style of tango.  Some 
people--mostly beginners and those performing on stage--dance with a more 
open embrace.

If we are to claim differences between the so-called milonguero- and 
salon-style dances, I would point to differences in the woman's footwork 
on turns and to the relative use of double-time steps.

In terms of following experience, close embrace to me pretty much means 
variable embrace.  I was in a class at CITA with Naveira and he was 
coming around to each of the pairs and corrected my partner of the 
moment, who was a pretty new beginner.  We were dancing more-or-less 
close embrace (having learned as a beginner in open embrace it was 
extremely close embrace to me) and my partner was trying to dance me 
into a space that my body simply couldn't occupy, for front ochos and 
for giro.  Naveira told him "you have to change and make the space for 
the woman, and then you change and go back."  Obviously ochos and giros 
can be made bigger and smaller (hence the stage and salon style 
discussions) but at some point the space inside of the right arm for a 
front ocho is either big enough for the follow, or it's not.  Depending 
on the amount of COD moves the lead chooses to lead, there will be a lot 
of transitions in the embrace.  I applaud the men with whom I have 
danced who have made this a seamless experience! :) The reality, 
however, is that this adjustment is a pretty difficult challenge for 
beginning dancers who lead, and it is not an issue in open embrace.  I 
am not "advocating" open embrace over close embrace...just acknowledging 
that it is really important to teach leads the space transition for COD 
dance vocabulary and it is a lot for a beginner to handle.

Dear Tangueros,

You seem to forget that Argentines are fundamentally Italian. For example, look at the names of all the great tango bandleaders and composers... even the dancers, and let's not forget the majority of the Argentina Yellow Pages!

What is it they say?

"An Argentine is...
an Italian who speaks Spanish,
wants to be British,
dresses like the French,
and is arrogant like the Germans".

By the way, don't flame me! This is a quote but I can't remember where I saw it.

Very best wishes

Hi Jake,

First, because I honestly don't know what other teachers do
because I'm too busy to pay close attention (and around
here, folks usually send newbies to me for their first trip
onto the dance floor).  Some teachers I can see teaching
away from the pisa and then letting the newbies out.  I'm
sure other women do the same thing I do.  

And I also wanted to gauge where your experiences are
regarding people.  Since I believe you were tango-raised in
established commmunities (NYC, right?), the things you
focus on will naturally be different from mine.  It helps
me put your commments into perspective, which sometimes
seem more "bookish" to me than "real-life".  

Speaking of which, I have to agree with Jeff's comments
about the common man & democracy.  Regardless of whether
American history books are just propaganda, it's still what
the average person believes.

But I also believe that such thinking lies in the "American
Dream", the belief that with hard work you can become
anything you want.  Why my parents left the dictatorship
and poverty (in their area) of the Phillipines to raise a
family in the States.  

And even a kid from a drug-ridden neighborhood, can escape
the ghetto, become a rap star, and make millions.

Trini de Pittsburgh

Carol,

In my experience, everyone talking about "variable embrace " have no idea
what close embrace is.

Close Embrace is definitely NOT variable embrace.

Those who say so are trying to disguise their un-ability to perform certain
elements and figures in close embrace whatever their names are.

But variable embrace exists. And it is only for those who mastered all types
of embrace: open and close with all their variations.

To me, the best example of "variable" embrace mastery is Orlando Paiva and
his students. What magical moves they have!

please leave the fishes in the aquarium. Your quoting godfather might provoque rampant serious misunderstandings about taste and humour. 

Keep in mind there are tango ladies on this list that appreciate refined gentle manners ;) 

thank you for your understanding

Before I get down to a detailed response to Jake let me say that this 
strays quite far off the tango list. Skip it at this point if you like. 
I will say that this is the last I will post about this to the list. I'm 
more than happy to chat about it off-list but since this might get to be 
very active it just won't be fair to the listeras/listeros.

There are two issues to address here. One is why I wrote the initial 
post and the second is the direct response to Jakes commentary.

===== Why I wrote it
This has to do with how we Americans talk about ourselves. It has been 
my experience that Americans don't have that much exposure to foreign 
cultures and consequently assume many behaviors that are culturally 
dependent are just natural. Part of our character is to be modest and 
somewhat self-deprecating. Other countries would never do that and don't 
view it the same way at all and I've more than once seen the situation 
abroad where the American is being polite (his/her estimate) with a 
small self-putdown and everyone else hops on the bandwagon to put them 
down too. They  never put each other down but since the American started 
it.... Because of this it can be hard to get us to talk about ourselves 
(my psychologist friends can go on about this at length and make a 
comfortable living because of it). When asked about ourselves we are far 
more likely to skip explaining what we are doing and start a critique of 
it. This is quite a good thing in many ways because if we have a 
disagreement you beat me to the punch so I never have to publicly 
criticize you plus I get to tell you have fair & honest you are. Other 
cultures would never admit to making a mistake publicly. This leaves us 
sounding at best disingenuous or at worse dishonest to them. Case in 
point is the recent and troubling example of the strong criticism from 
the Islamicist: They ask us why our system is so great and we just can't 
seem to tell them. That means either we are lying and it's no good (so 
we're dishonest which feeds their paranoia), or it works great and they 
can't be part of it (so we're racists or anti-Muslim). Mix that in with 
a strongly honor-based culture  which seems oddly quaint to us but is a 
matter of life and death for them and, well, things just get to be a 
complete mess in short order. So again, my initial aim was for giving 
our view for people who have no context for it and aren't likely to get 
it from us.

Jake, you slipped into this exact mode, by the way...

Sorry Jake, but sticking words in my mouth then telling me I'm wrong 
does not cut it. The issue is *how* American attitudes toward commoners 
have influenced our approach to democracy, in turn our behaviors to each 
other and how we look at the whole thing.

WOW! You mean you actually have valid statistics from this time period? 
Do you have any idea how many historians would kill for that? In point 
of fact you made up that number. If you didn't then give me cites.

No I'm not. The Colonies at the time had largely been forgotten about up 
until the earlier 1700's (since no more Aztec gold was to be found) when 
England tried to forceably re-assert control over them and pull them 
squarely into the (very evil)  mercantile system. This caused very 
widespread antagonism especially in New England. The push was initially 
for representation in Parliament which was flatly vetoed. At best a 
Virginia planter who was managing an estate 10 times the size of someone 
in the House of Lords would be referred to as a "country squire" and 
treated that way. One famous example was Benjamin Franklin who had done 
good basic research in electricity and held a couple of honorary 
doctorates. He went to England in the early 1770's and could barely even 
get an audience with anyone plus was routinely insulted to his face. He 
went home and wrote famously & causticly about British excesses.  Ever 
been to Vandalia Ohio? This was another typical if large-scale example. 
A huge tract of land was set up in that area to re-establish the feudal 
system in North America. Yes, you read that right. The English gentry 
was genuinely bewildered that the Americans didn't give up their farms 
and flock to the new manors and the whole thing was stillborn.

So you used to write Army manuals which are, of course, paradigms of

Fred Astaire was *not* an elite in the sense I'm talking about.  Most 
plots had Fred in some ill-defined but boring career. The point was that 
Fred wasn't otherwise special but man oh man could he dance,  so we 
could aspire to be like him. This is still very much in line with 
American ideas and this occurs over and over again in popular 
entertainment. How do you think the American public would have reacted 
if he were a sniffy English Lord? How about a draconian German Baron?

really? Jimmy Carter was a peanut farmer and was about the last major 
democratic candidate to profess such a background. Now we have 
techno-dweebs like Al Gore. Can you imagine him talking to a bunch of 
truckers? There is no way he could convince them he has similar 
experiences to them. The shift that happened starting back in the Reagan 
era was that the Republicans became the party for the commoners. Up 
until that time they were seen as being chiefly the party of the super 
rich. One reason I am distressed by this personally is that many of my 
supposed liberal college professor sorts are appalled at your average 
Joe and have made strongly anti-democratic statements. It is un-nerving 
to hear someone like that talk about how we have to bring democracy 
everywhere as a panacea  in one breadth and in the next seriously talk 
about taking voting rights away from large parts of their own 
population. This is not good.

Again, a fine dismissal that doesn't apply. True I am a musician, but I 
started out on a farm and am very comfortable with the working class. 
Probably more so than with many professional colleagues. Americans 
generally feel very uncomfortable being special and tend to try and 
shrug it off. This is very different from, say, my Japanese friends who 
simply assume that there are differences and have no trouble flatly 
stating them. Most Americans  find them weirdly polite and cruel at the 
same time.

*NO* Democracy can work just fine with no such rights. These are a 
peculiarly American approach to __preserving__ the individual in a mass 
society -- which presupposes there is something about individual rights 
that is worth preserving.. Keep these ideas separate since one 
fashionable way to discredit democracy (e.g. in Japan & China) is to 
point to the American emphasis on "crass individualism" as being 
intrinsic to it.

Which is a common theme not just in the US but in most Western European 
countries too. Look at 18th century Spaniards bemoaning that every one 
was styling himself as a gentleman ("senior"). This is more an outgrowth 
of the Enlightenment rather than an specifically American thing. The 
idea was that one should extend to rights of the aristocracy to all. 
Contrast this with a Soviet-style revolution where everyone gets to be a 
peasant. Or a Nazi-type one where almost everyone ends up a slave.

Now you're starting to make some sense. Yes, part of American culture on 
the one hand is to have a strongly romanticized notion of commoners 
while marginally differentiate oneself as above it all. This has been 
around almost since the first settlements. Most recently it is seen in 
"multi-culturalism" (see R. Jacoby's brilliant analysis) where we are to 
allow lip-service of differences for barely indistinguishable social 
groups. This is still better than European-style multiculturalism which 
is just a really fancy word for segregation. [I lived in Germany for 11 
years and got shoved into a few ghettos too, so I know whereof I speak.]

I don't think so. It *sounds* more practical to take Spanish courses but 
unless there are speakers at hand the effect is again to have the mere 
rudiments of a foreign language as a conversation piece. Sure there are 
places where you can learn it, but where I live (small Midwest college 
town, few Spanish speakers) there is hardly much difference in which 
language they take. Spanish just has some more bragging rights with it.

Such as your current example? I'll cheerily admit to glossing over some 
of the harder points, but the reason for the post was to try and give 
foreigners a view from our perspective and to support the independent 
observation that Americans seem to have a hard time with certain aspects 
of a foreign culture.

the social dance floor with them to live tango music."

Dear List,  Brian and Deb, Gustavo and Giselle: 

Let me preface what I am about to say by affirming that I have no
financial connection either with Dance of the Heart in Boulder Co,  or
to Gustavo Naveira and Giselle Anne  "G/G". The only reason I am writing
this is to convey my sincere gratitude to Brian Dunn, Deb Sclar, Gustavo
Naveira, and Giselle Anne,  for providing two weeks of tango bliss and
inspiration  I will never forget.  

It is really difficult to put into words how extraordinary this program
was, from the organization of events, the quality of the venues, the
combination of instruction and social dance opportunities, plus some
time to hike the gorgeous Rockies,  the sincere good nature of the
hosts, Brian and Deb, the genuine open friendliness of the dancers of
the Boulder and Denver area, (miraculously, every cabaceo I sent out was
accepted! Colorado followers, rock on! ) and most of all, the incredible
quality of the teaching of G/G.   In my humble opinion, G/G are the best
in the world at what they do, which is to convey the essence of tango,
the structure of the dance, the beauty and quality of the movements, the
passion, the theory, musicality, rhythm, phrasing; Gustavo and Giselle
give you the total package, with their full heart and soul.  They open
your eyes to the possiblities in Tango, they give you the tools, and
then it is up to you to practice, and use those tools to create you own
personal interpretation and style.    

Yes, they deserve deification,  or whatever accolade you can think of,
including Buddha, the path to tango enlightenment.  True, they may not
have the only path, but it is the most clearly marked trail this tango
hiker has ever experienced.   I have only been dancing for 9 years, but
I have had the good fortune to experience many different talented
teachers, here in the US as well as in BA,  each having unique
strengths.  This is subjective of course,  and what impresses me may not
impress others on this list.    For example, just to name one other
inspiring teacher,  Gavito was unique in his conveyance of passion, for
me he had  the "heart" of tango.  Gustavo has, in addition to  the
passion, the Mind, the living brains of tango.  I do not easily use the
word "genius".  But here the word is warranted.    His analysis of how,
why, when, and where things work or dont work,  look elegant or not, fit
the music or not, communicate with your partner or not,  is simply on
the highest level.   The performances of G/G at two of the milongas were
amazing, after a full day of exhausting workshops at mile high Boulder
altitude they delivered four dynamic, sublime, moving,  dance numbers
per night that, like you guys,  brought tears to my eyes as well, which
took me by surprise, that has not happened to me before during a tango
performance.  If you really love tango, if it touches you at your core,
how could you not cry during that experience?   You knew you were
witnessing world  class partnership movement in musicality, artistry
that you might never be lucky enough to see again. 

Brian, I really don't think you should take seriously any of the
simplistic negative comments from anyone on the list, either they are
playing devils advocate for purposes of debate or attention, or they
have never attended a full G/G seminar week,  so they are ignorant on
the subject.   In any event, perhaps it is not a good idea for me to
tell the world how incredible G/G are, as I am happy to keep them a
"secret" for those of us who treasure such a resource, so we don't have
to fight for a slot in their seminars :-).   
I beg you to repeat the encuentro at least once a year!

Love, 
Martin Nussbaum

I have come to believe that, since the term "close embrace" can mean
  several different things, it leads to a lot of confusion.
  The more erect you and your partner are when you are in your embrace,
  the closer your feet are together. The more forward "lean" there is to 
  both of your postures, the more distance there is between your feet,
  plenty enough for the woman to bring her unweighted foot across and 
  in front of herself.
  Note, too, that when the two upper bodies are parallel to each other, it is
  possible, by rotating the upper body/bodies appropriately, and changing the 
  amount of forward pressure, for the woman to feel the desire to let her leg 
  go in the indicated direction, across the front of her body.
  My experience tells me, though, that the actual physical connection that 
  I get from most partners is so weak (ie close embrace means standing 
  really close to your partner) that the woman can't feel this sort of lead. Then,
  too, there is the challenge of being able to rotate the torso more or less 
  independently of the hips, and vice versa, so that the leg can move freely
  in the direction of the woman's new balance point...
  It takes both partners being on the same page to make this work. No opening 
  of the embrace is required.
  On the other hand, if you want to open the embrace, go right ahead.

  In terms of following experience, close embrace to me pretty much means 
variable embrace. I was in a class at CITA with Naveira and he was 
coming around to each of the pairs and corrected my partner of the 
moment, who was a pretty new beginner. We were dancing more-or-less 
close embrace (having learned as a beginner in open embrace it was 
extremely close embrace to me) and my partner was trying to dance me 
into a space that my body simply couldn't occupy, for front ochos and 
for giro. Naveira told him "you have to change and make the space for 
the woman, and then you change and go back." Obviously ochos and giros 
can be made bigger and smaller (hence the stage and salon style 
discussions) but at some point the space inside of the right arm for a 
front ocho is either big enough for the follow, or it's not. Depending 
on the amount of COD moves the lead chooses to lead, there will be a lot 
of transitions in the embrace. I applaud the men with whom I have 
danced who have made this a seamless experience! :) The reality, 
however, is that this adjustment is a pretty difficult challenge for 
beginning dancers who lead, and it is not an issue in open embrace. I 
am not "advocating" open embrace over close embrace...just acknowledging 
that it is really important to teach leads the space transition for COD 
dance vocabulary and it is a lot for a beginner to handle.

Hmmm.. The embrace in tango can be variable or not. In the Apilado style, it 
is not variable at all. The dancers are connected at the chest and and the 
woman's left arm is draped over the man's shoulder. Their other arm is held 
loosely and the hand connection is also without tension or energy. I have 
experienced this first hand from such Apilado teachers as Susana Miller (I 
dance with her every time I see her at a milonga). I've also danced with 
other women who teach and dance that style exclusively and they all dance 
that way.

Another thing I've noticed is that some women who've learned that style tend 
to lean or even hang on the man. I don't know why this happens because the 
teachers (such as Susana Miller) quit teaching that stuff years ago. A close 
embrace is what all tango dancing requires. One can relax the embrace and 
make it variable in order to dance some figures. With skilled partners I 
find it very easy to dance a good variety of movements while maintaining a 
very close embrace. However, if the women hang on me or lean on me, the 
dance becomes quite limited.

Also, I enjoy dancing with partners who can dance more interesting steps or 
moves. Some movements require a lot more flexibility in the embrace as it's 
impossible to perform them if the dancers are glued at the chest. For 
instance, any turn requiring more than 3 steps to either direction is much 
easier to perform if the embrace is loosened. Centrifugal force is very much 
in evidence for many tango steps. This requires that the dancers actually 
lean away from each other. Try sometimes  taking hands with another person 
and turning circles around one another. You'll see how easy it is if you 
lean away from each other. If you lean towards each other, it's impossible 
to do.

Things like sacadas, barridas, ganchos and boleos are movements that 
originate from places in the turn (molinete, giro, etc.). All these moves 
are generated from changes of direction in the turn. All these movements are 
more easily performed with a relaxed, open embrace. Before I get flamed, let 
me hasten to ad that small boleos, sacadas and even displacements can be 
successfully done in close embrace (I do them all the time). However, no 
gancho, barrida or back sacada can be done during a close, apilado position.

Obviously, some people enjoy dancing a variety of dance moves and steps and 
enjoy the freedom of interpreting the music with more variety. OTOH, some 
people hate anything that is not their style of dance. Usually, those who 
can, enjoy dancing a variety of styles. Even some people who are not so 
skilled enjoy trying out fancy moves they see others do. Unfortunately, when 
unskilled dancers attempt more advanced moves, they usually look less than 
elegant and can interfere with other dancers on the floor. Still, this is no 
reason to rail against different styles of tango or to question their 
authenticity, validiity, etc. A variable embrace is indeed a very fine thing 
to use if needed. A close embrace is also just fine and quite pleasant to 
use.

Enjoy your own dance!!

of working with Gustavo
Naveira and Giselle Anne, learning from them, sitting with tears in our
eyes
watching them dance, listening to their music choices as DJ's, and
sharing
the social dance floor with them to live tango music."

Dear List,  Brian and Deb, Gustavo and Giselle: 

Let me preface what I am about to say by affirming that I have no
financial connection either with Dance of the Heart in Boulder Co,  or
to Gustavo Naveira and Giselle Anne  "G/G". The only reason I am writing
this is to convey my sincere gratitude to Brian Dunn, Deb Sclar, Gustavo
Naveira, and Giselle Anne,  for providing two weeks of tango bliss and
inspiration  I will never forget.  

It is really difficult to put into words how extraordinary this program
was, from the organization of events, the quality of the venues, the
combination of instruction and social dance opportunities, plus some
time to hike the gorgeous Rockies,  the sincere good nature of the
hosts, Brian and Deb, the genuine open friendliness of the dancers of
the Boulder and Denver area, (miraculously, every cabaceo I sent out was
accepted! Colorado followers, rock on! ) and most of all, the incredible
quality of the teaching of G/G.   In my humble opinion, G/G are the best
in the world at what they do, which is to convey the essence of tango,
the structure of the dance, the beauty and quality of the movements, the
passion, the theory, musicality, rhythm, phrasing; Gustavo and Giselle
give you the total package, with their full heart and soul.  They open
your eyes to the possiblities in Tango, they give you the tools, and
then it is up to you to practice, and use those tools to create you own
personal interpretation and style.    

Yes, they deserve deification,  or whatever accolade you can think of,
including Buddha, the path to tango enlightenment.  True, they may not
have the only path, but it is the most clearly marked trail this tango
hiker has ever experienced.   I have only been dancing for 9 years, but
I have had the good fortune to experience many different talented
teachers, here in the US as well as in BA,  each having unique
strengths.  This is subjective of course,  and what impresses me may not
impress others on this list.    For example, just to name one other
inspiring teacher,  Gavito was unique in his conveyance of passion, for
me he had  the "heart" of tango.  Gustavo has, in addition to  the
passion, the Mind, the living brains of tango.  I do not easily use the
word "genius".  But here the word is warranted.    His analysis of how,
why, when, and where things work or dont work,  look elegant or not, fit
the music or not, communicate with your partner or not,  is simply on
the highest level.   The performances of G/G at two of the milongas were
amazing, after a full day of exhausting workshops at mile high Boulder
altitude they delivered four dynamic, sublime, moving,  dance numbers
per night that, like you guys,  brought tears to my eyes as well, which
took me by surprise, that has not happened to me before during a tango
performance.  If you really love tango, if it touches you at your core,
how could you not cry during that experience?   You knew you were
witnessing world  class partnership movement in musicality, artistry
that you might never be lucky enough to see again. 

Brian, I really don't think you should take seriously any of the
simplistic negative comments from anyone on the list, either they are
playing devils advocate for purposes of debate or attention, or they
have never attended a full G/G seminar week,  so they are ignorant on
the subject.   In any event, perhaps it is not a good idea for me to
tell the world how incredible G/G are, as I am happy to keep them a
"secret" for those of us who treasure such a resource, so we don't have
to fight for a slot in their seminars :-).   
I beg you to repeat the encuentro at least once a year!

Love, 
Martin Nussbaum

A thought:

We give them multiple reasons to be unimpressed.  many reasons 
have nought to do with the quality of our dance.  I think most 
often they are not impressed with us as people.

Plenty of people come to a tango practice or class to meet new 
people.  They tend to be rather nice people, IMO.  However they 
want more than just a sense of welcome, but a feeling of being 
around people just like like them.

In a small community, it doesn't take much to get them to decide 
that they won't be happy, and so off they go.  This in fact has 
little to do with how nice the people in the group themselves 
are.  It's a matter of perception, and how other people interpret 
minor events we don't see as important.

It's hard to get out of the trap of being a small community in
a smaller city.   There seems to be a barrier at 20 people they 
find hard to break through.

In larger towns, multiple small circles interact; those truly 
motivated to learn the dance can go elsewhere if they don't 
like their current location.

Based on my conversations over many years with people who
left tango, decided not to continue, etc., Christopher's
comments are accurate.  It was certainly a problem here,
partly because of the impression that tango was hard or was
for "thinking people".  As one of our most committed
students once told me ("I had heard about tango earlier,
but for some reason I thought it was elitist.  I can't
point to specific thing, though, that gave me that
impression.")

Aside from that, comments of the non-committed were mostly
about their own scheduling issues or finances.  Or in the
case of Pittsburghers, they move to other cities.  Sigh.

Otherwise, I hadn't heard many comments about tango being
too difficult to learn or that it was unimpressive.

"Try sometimes taking hands with another person and turning circles around
one another. You'll see how easy it is if you lean away from each other. If
you lean towards each other, it's impossible to do."

Igor:
"I am not quite sure what you mean. If you mean Molinete, giro, it is
possible to do. I do it every milonga with a variety of partners."

Manuel:
"However, no gancho, barrida or back sacada can be done during a close,
apilado position."

Igor:
Gancho is one of the easiest elements for close embrace. Barriada - no
problem. Back sacada - I do not know. I do not know how to make back sacadas
in any embrace.

Manuel, 
Close embrace requires different technique. And it works fine !

Manuel:
"Things like sacadas, barridas, ganchos and boleos are movements that
originate from places in the turn (molinete, giro, etc.). All these moves
are generated from changes of direction in the turn."

That is only a very special, partial view on the thighs. That is the Naveira
theory. Of course, with this approach you will not be able to make a gancho
in tight apilado.

You guys, Tango Nuevo supporters and followers, do not even assume that
there are other ways of doing things !
Open your eyes !

Ah, I get it. The problem is she didn't learn these steps from you.

Good leaders do not pressure women to "move and do the step". Such 
pressure comes only from bad teachers and bad leaders. Good leaders make 
the dance out of whatever she can do naturally and comfortably.

Instead of trying to fix the girl, you could ask yourself where these bad 
leaders learned their bad leading.

Which is a true staement if you avoid Villa Malcolm and maybe 
Sunderland and other some other milongas away from downtown.

On the other hand, check out the video of Finito on Youtube
(from the 80's I think).  Close or open?  I say close.

Not to nitpick, but are you avoiding bias?  Consider these 
ideas:

a. Upper-class control of the media in Argentina dictated 
   that the open embrace dance they favored was more worthy 
   of recording.

b. Your evidence is a poor sample of what's available.

Moreover, does tango 1910 to 1940 in Europe and America 
really count in terms of cultural validity?  Many would 
heartily disagree that the history of International 
Standard and American Ballroom Tango bear on the question, 
myself included.

Finally, verbal histories passed on from Famous Old Farts 
Now Dead indicate that the closeness of the embrace has 
always been a vital concern in BA.  Tomas Howlin once related
a charming explanation from one of his teachers as to why 
the cruzada enjoyed immediate popularity from the time its 
possibilities began being actively explored in the mid to 
late 30's--it seems the men enjoyed the even tighter embrace 
they could obtain with it.  Damn those cuddlers anyway!

Many theories treat emotional experience as something 
built on top of our systems for physical sensation.  
For instance, we use terms like having a crush, being 
crushed, tongue-tied, breathless, flying, up or down 
to convey emotional states, all of which correlate to
actual physical sensations.

So it makes sense that the far more mammalian experience 
of close embrace might disinhibit our emotional centers 
in ways open embrace does not.

Artistic abilities are certainly more than mere technical
skills, but you need emotional content before you can 
communicate it, yes?

Good, realtime feedback is the best situation for rapid 
learning.  Close embrace far excels open in this regard.

You can slime your way through a tanda in open embrace and 
convince yourself you did great much more easily in open 
embrace.

You would have a much harder time lying to yourself about 
the quality of your close embrace dancing, because many 
times the amount of body sensation is telling you how well
or badly things are going.

So the learning curve is steeper, but you have much more
to work with, so progress should be faster.

Gavito with Maria Plazaola, CITA 2003 DVD, Side A, second half.  

He spends a good part of that song leading high velocity turns 
with many sacadas, lapizes, etc in open embrace.  It's not any 
less dramatic or emotional than the initial moments in close 
embrace.

What's attention getting is outstanding dancing in any embrace.
There's so very little of it.

> 5. "In open embrace separation between partners, larger movements,

Nailing weight transfers over a distance of 48 inches/120cm 
requires 4 times the power and twice the precision in timing 
a 24 inch/60 cm weight transfer needs.  As movement size goes
up, physical demands quickly ramp up beyond the average human's 
physical limitations.

This is high school physics:

power = force / time
force = mass * acceleration
velocity = acceleration * time 
distance = velocity * time

Is it any wonder that ex-ballerinas and modern dancers dominate
the current crop of female stage dancers (we can discuss if 
they actually all dance high quality tango some other time)?

See my response to item 3 above.  The unforgiving nature of 
close embrace is precisely what causes rapid improvement in
close embrace dancers.

Ridiculous.  You seem to say the matter is beyond choice.  Claiming 
the music dictates the embrace, much less anything else is complete 
and utter bullshit.  The music is an external circumstance, your 
reaction is what dictates your personal choices in embrace and indeed 
all other behaviors.  And your reaction is nothing more than a matter 
mental conditioning, definitely a matter of personal choice.

I can hear in my mind your defense in a personal injury case, "Your 
Honor, the facts of the case are not in dispute.  However, it's all 
the fault of the orchestra leader Osvaldo Pugliese--his music aroused 
such passion in me, that at a crucial moment in the song 'Zum', I 
had no choice but to lead my partner in a high round kick, making 
her Comme il Faut stilleto heel impacted plaintiff's breast, causing 
her implant to rupture.  Therefore I submit a motion to dismiss with 
prejudice, and invite plaintiff to join me in a class-action suit 
against Mr. Pugliese's estate."

Also, just because they can dance small in open frame (I saw Oscar 
Mandagaran do this one night at Gricel), does not mean open frame
dancers typically do.  Granted, I've never danced east of Urbana, 
Illinois or west of Denver, so I don't know for a fact that open
embrace dancers are more disciplined on the coasts, but I have a 
very hard time imagining it's markedly different.

Mind you, I'm not dissing you for your choices in embrace, but I
say you should at least take responsibility for them.

Agreed, while also noting this condition passes rather quickly.

There is a much larger population, "old-timers that suck" we 
should acknowledge.  A classic example is the guy that takes all 
of 2 bars to set up a gancho, and then improves the return on his 
investment of time by leading one or 2 more over the next bar, 
then wastes another entire bar disengaging.

Another gargantuan crock of manure:

A. Open embrace dancers see close embrace dancers as blocking 
the line of dance because they seem on average inclined to take 
longer strides.

B. Just who is this somebody teaching close embrace dancers to 
block the line of dance and not progress around the floor?

C. Perhaps you confuse the notion of not being in a hurry to 
get around the floor with deliberately obstructing the line of 
dance.  Not being in a hurry would include all the mannerly 
things we should be doing, like: not passing, going all the way 
into corners, not breathing down the neck of the guy in front 
of you and so on.

D. What actually gets people around the dance floor in a hurry, 
actually has nothing to do with the embrace or stride length.  
It's the extent to which the interpretation of the music is 
shared such that couples all move forward down the line of 
dance at the same time.  Otherwise, we are forced to wait for 
the space to open up for us, which opens the space for the guy 
behind and so on until the space comes around again.  The US 
being the land of rugged individualism, I see no alternative 
to patience at hand.

E. Finally a counterexample: I once saw an open embrace dancer 
billing herself as "one of the best female leads in the country" 
block the line of dance so badly that half the room was empty 
in front of  her ... one more reason teaching at milongas deserves
the nuclear option.  Her turns sure were pretty though.

The one statement I agree with entirely in the entire post.

Instead of trying to fix the girl, you could ask yourself where your bad 
leaders learned their bad leading.

This can be fine, or problematic, depending on the man and the  
woman.  If she has strength, balance, trust, etc and the guy is a  
good leader who chooses the right moment, it can be great, whether  
she has been taught it or not.

Without those, he shouldn't be leading it!

But, guys do!

I've seen this a lot from guys who don't go to classes at all (maybe  
they've seen it in a show? or see other people doing it on the  
milonga floor and try to copy what they think they see?), as well as  
from ones fresh out of classes which don't teach leading, but 'moves'  
-- or which teach this stuff to men or women who are not ready for it.

Also,  so many women seem to get a weird idea of what these things  
are, from sitting at a milonga watching,  or from the whole range of  
other sources I've listed before. Plus, from guys who wrench her  
through some parody of it while 'teaching' her on the dance floor, or  
give verbal instructions on the floor.  Certainly, it  doesn't need  
the intercession of a bad teacher to plant these evil seeds - people  
seem able to produce them from scratch! But also, even when women are  
learning just fine from a good teacher and lots of practice, or are  
just practicing and dancing and working out fine, it seems to only  
take one lesson from a crap teacher where they do 'the man puts his  
leg here and then the woman lifts her leg here' type of instruction,  
and they're off doing self -led 'gancho' impressions, to the dismay  
of those around them on the floor. Which is very hard to stop them  
from doing -- so I am glad there are teachers who subsequently  teach  
them that this is not a gancho (even though that effectively means  
saying that the other teacher,or that guy on the floor, was wrong!)

I agree that its often more important for women to be told by someone  
what a gancho or boleo is _not_ -- to stop them anticipating them.  
And then they can get back to developing their dancing skills to the  
point where a guy will lead them in these moves and it will 'just  
work', without her having to 'know' it.

>
> Beginners are easily impressed.

Sadly, this does seem to be true around here.  And women, more so  
than men, mostly, in my observation - though there are some men  
attracted to the girl doing the high flicks and stuff, and don't  
notice that while she is doing that, the guy she is dancing with is  
gritting his teeth and waiting for the song to end before someone  
loses an eye or he loses his back...

I've spoken to quite a few women where they say they were initially  
keen to do dance with the guys who dragged them through complex  
stuff, and they did not see anything particularly desirable in  
dancing with guys who were  musical, and attentive, and only led what  
could their partner  could dance. Partly because most women cannot  
see it - and as beginners, they may not feel it either. Later , these  
women discovered the joy of these other leaders, and left the  
wrestlers behind.  The wrestlers then move on to the next crop of  
beginners, often undermining good classes and good practice with  
others....  Its a hard cycle to break. We can all see where they are  
getting the bad habits from -- these few leaders, or one bad teacher  
--  but its hard to stop it happening. Hopefully they will stick at  
it long enough to have an epiphany of some kind.

How you stop these bad leaders developing is harder. For a few, its  
clear: they go to teachers who teach bad stuff, which they repeat.  
But I've seen guys produce bad stuff of their own accord, without  
teachers;  and others where no matter what class they go to, they  
come out of it with a 'move' which they have to explain verbally to  
the woman -- even when the class has been explicitly not about that,  
and others have got other things entirely from it.  Maybe for some  
people, if they start tango from a 'dance is steps that the man and  
woman learn' point of view, they will always see everything through  
that prism: classes, what other dancers are doing, what their partner  
says afterwards, why certain people don't want to dance with them...

In any community, sometimes newbies just aren't interested in the dance 
they see, whether they appreciate it or not, regardless of our ability. 
Not everyone is as smitten as we are. I've met plenty of people who've 
tried it, didn't give a damn, and are content to watch if it's in the 
same room, but otherwise couldn't care less.

This is why I question the value (except to the teacher collecting cash) 
of trying to ensure that everyone enjoys their first lesson, or first 
six, or first six months, or whatever. Most of us (I assume) can spot a 
permanent dropout in 5 minutes. Why pester them and try to collect their 
money for another few weeks? If they like it, they'll return.

Else, let them find something that fulfills who they are, rather than 
who we'd like them to be.

I think that's the problem I see: we actually cannot, reliably.  And  
in fact many of the people I know who dance and love tango were  
initially put off by other aspects of their first encounter, not that  
they didn't like the dance. And the (slightly artificially  
constructed) welcome that they subsequently got, brought them in.

BTW this has nothing to do with financial gain -- I don't get any  
money from tango. Its my time I'm wasting, all I might get back is  
more people to dance with; and I choose to use some of my time being  
welcoming to newcomers. I make an effort to take away some of those  
obstacles at first impressions. And that doesn't necessarily mean  
sending them to lessons, especially as the first thing.

I can see how if someone is making money from teaching tango, and  
isn't interested in building this tango community, then they might be  
tempted to tout paid lessons even to people they know won't stick at  
it. I assume this happens in those ballroom studios that also teach  
tango.  But, those teachers don't even come to practicas and milongas  
-- they are not part of the tango community. The teachers who are,  
seem to take actually helping people get on the dance floor pretty  
seriously, and with some success.

But maybe welcoming people just matters more here, where there are so  
few of us. Eg here, there are maybe 40-50 tango regulars (of which  
maybe 20 are die-hards), maybe another 50 occasional attenders. And  
the next place where there is tango is 3 hours drive, and the place  
after that, 8 hours drive. So, if a couple of guys turn up at a  
practica and look interested, of course we try to bring them in!

Whereas in a place where you already have plenty of dancers, plenty  
of good dancers, and plenty of choices of tango activities, there is  
no longer a need to maximise these opportunities.  Maybe then you can  
rely on getting enough people in to keep things going, with only  
those with that heady mix of a driving desire to take up tango,  
together with abundant natural talent. I dream.

Cheers

Gary

I'll pass, thanks. But others hereabouts might like to know of his

Is he aware that he needs to post to Tango-A?  I think it is 
important to not use harsh methods if the person is not aware.

Suggestion.

Other lists I belong to have a message posted every month called 
"Administrivia" with the 'rules of the road'.  While there are rules for 
tango-l, many people haven't seen them in a while and forget them. 
Those who know them (or are irritated at the need for this) can just 
look at the subject header, delete and not read.  If they are updated 
the message subject is "Administrivia - updated."

Also, if we remind someone that their post is wrong in a private email, 
let's make sure we also include a link to the rules in the archive.

I know there's no moderator but a helpful volunteer could cut and paste 
the rules and send a single recurring email on the first of every month.

A little bit of netiquette.

Hi everyone,
 
I haven't written to this list in a long time and also I apologize if I am taking this out of context or anything but I had to pipe in when I saw this statement from (I believe it was) Dani:
 
"The man is the predator, the woman is the prey, as has been since time immemorial "
 
First of all, I am not going to argue that the above statement might be the opinion of some.  But I think it's a really narrow minded way of looking at the complexity of the relationship between men and women.  And it inspires me to address what I often find to be a misconceived view of the relationship between the leader and follower in tango.
 
Sometimes I have found that men get on these power trips about leading and neglect to acknowledge the true fact that the follower has an equal amount of influence on the dance and that it is truly a partnership.  Even the most machismo men can not deny the powerful role of the follower.
 
Here are a couple of things to consider about the role of the follower and her power to influence the dance:
 
1. It is the woman's choice who she dances with.  She allows herself to be approached or not, she selects whether or not to catch a man's gaze.  I would go so far as to say that most of the time it is really the woman doing the asking with her posture and eye contact and not really the other way around.
 
2. The follower is in control of the dance.  Without someone who has agreed to follow you, there can be no lead.  There is nothing "prey"-like about this and it is a completely conscious and active choice on the part of the follower.  Without her trust and response your lead means nothing.  Also, the way in which she interprets the lead is her choice, so as a leader you have to be aware of and open to the possibilities she presents.
 
3. The follower has an extremely influential role in the expression of musicality.  Her timing, responsiveness, and the manner in which she executes the movements which are lead are all completely her responsibility.  Also, the spaces in between what you lead are hers to play with.
 
The best dances happen when both the leader and follower are striving to make the dance delicious for the other person while confidently expressing their personal uniqueness in a warm and trusting embrace.  
 
Be kind to one another. Don't confuse femininity and masculinity with weak and strong or predator and prey.

Agreed. Reporting as spam seems inappropriate IMO. Better to just tell them they've violated the list guidelines, and refer them to http://Tango-L.com for instructions and protocols.

This is a technical message.

Dear writers,

I am sure you all care how your postings appear on Internet.
For example recent post of the Razor Girl:

http://pythia.uoregon.edu/%7Ellynch/Tango-L/2006/msg05486.html - lines are
too long in Internet Explorer to fit into a page. Unreadable.

Here is the main address of the Web archive of the list:

Fix formatting of your messages, please !

PS,
And please, Hugo,
Do not post here any more,
One time was enough for everyone to notice.
You give a bad example, and if it happens again, we will have to take some
measures against it.
Thank you for understanding!

I have wrote to Hugo about where promo messages should
be sent to (Tango-A instead of Tango-L), and the
frequency of those messages.

Hugo is aware of the info but choose to spam the list.

I'm coming late to this thread, but I have what is probably an 
interesting observation.

Some people (Nina, as an example) seem to 'feel' things.  They have a 
particular way of taking in and processing information.

Other people (David's son, see below) seem to do better if they have a 
structure so they can analyze things.

Both of these are valid ways of perceiving, processing and 
understanding. Psychologically they are quite different.

In addition to the cognitive difference above (well-recognized in 
Myers-Briggs and other psychological cognitive inventories), there is 
the physiological difference in people's mirror neuron skills.

Mirror neurons govern the ability to 'mimic' something you see in your 
own body kinetics. Some people are very good at learning by watching. 
While they are watching their sympathetic nervous system is rehearsing 
the very same move and learning the technique.  Others don't have quite 
so much of this in their body and they need to "step through" dance 
moves and positions slowly with a partner and "feel" it kinetically to 
understand and remember it.

Once again, it's the way we're made. No one can change it.  It does 
great damage to deprecate someone by saying "just lead!!! it's 
obvious!!!" or something like that.  Great way to discourage people who 
are not made the way you are, to whom it is not obvious.  They just need 
a different way of approaching and digesting the same information.

Good teachers will recognize these basic differences in personal style 
and aptitude and will teach a couple of different way to slice the bread 
to make the same sandwich.

Razorgirl, thank you for bringing up this topic.  You are right.  I 
am back at my computer, so everyone beware!  Here I go again!  Read 
this at your leisure, if you wish, because it might be a long 
message.  I don't know what it is going to be yet.

Razorgirl, I want to take your point a bit further.

In the non-tango world, the issues of power between men and women are 
perceived in a somewhat simplistic way because, however it looks, it 
works for most people and they do not want to look any further.

Tango is more intuitive, more sensitive and more demanding in that 
realm, whether you want it or not.

At the very first encounter, which may last a few months, a person's 
simple power emerges as an issue and stands in front of the person 
for consideration.  Am I good enough?  Will he/she dance with 
me?  Can I do this?  Can I invite?  Will he/she like me?  I am afraid.

Tango is a mirror of all of the insecurities a person may 
have.  When  a person, any person, begins to dance tango, Tango puts 
a mirror in front of them and says "Look!  These are your 
insecurities.  What do you want to do about them?  If you do nothing, 
you will be hurt and disappointed and you will not dance."

So people do.  Everyone.  Often unconsciously because they want the 
transformation that tango offers them.  This is my point that 
transcends cultures.  Argentine people go through this process as 
well.  It is a process of Tango.

A much deeper level of transformation actually allows the true 
masculine and feminine power to emerge.  Once a person begins to 
overcome their insecurities, it begins to show not only in tango, but 
in the rest of their life.  In a way, struggling and loving tango 
helps people to become who they truly are and who they were meant to 
be.  I don't want to talk about this right now.  It is a fascinating 
and exciting topic for me and it brings many concepts that I use when 
I share tango with others by teaching.  But this is about the power 
and so I want to stay with this focus.

The masculine and feminine power in tango do not compete with each 
other.  They do not take away from each other.  Instead, the feminine 
can only be powerful if the masculine is powerful and the masculine 
cannot be powerful if the feminine is not powerful.

In the ancient world, the feminine was presented as the true power of 
the Universe.  For those who have not had much learning about this, 
The DaVinci Code is a great presentation of that, both the book and the movie.

But both men and women have both the masculine and the 
feminine.  That means that the power of the Universe is in both, not 
just in the women.

I am speaking a somewhat Jungian language here because it is more 
congruent with the Western thought.

So in tango, the woman is not powerful if the man is not, and the 
man's power is trapped, if the woman he dances with is weak in her 
power.  That is why the follower's technique classes are very 
useful.  Women learn to connect with their bodies in the movement of 
tango and bring forward their powerful feminine essence.

When men feel, and I mean FEEL (because I know that you, gentlemen, 
like to talk about thinking, but live, navigate and negotiate by 
feeling that you do not talk about because it is a natural way of 
being for you) that the woman is not competing with them for THEIR 
power, they emerge powerful and free.

So, this was my point about the embrace.  When a man feels his power 
and embraces a woman in tango (or in life) from that power, it is 
pure, non-negotiable and fearless.  It can never be sleazy or 
insecure because sleazy means a block of a man's power and fear.

For that, ladies, you have a huge power.  If you accept an invitation 
to dance from your feminine power, gorgeous and secure, which every 
one of you has (it might be hidden, but it is there), the man, any 
man, even a rank beginner, has no choice but to show up in his best 
masculine power.  And men will be very grateful to you.  Not 
mentally, and often not consciously, but in feeling.

This is what Argentines practice subconsciously in life and in 
tango.  Consciously it is men, women and the 
relationships.  Subconsciously, it is the integrity of the feminine 
of masculine energy and power.

In the US, the feminist movement was much needed.  It was about 
resources and change of the social structure, and many things of this 
delicate balance between the masculine and feminine had to be 
sacrificed.  There was no other choice, even if there was another awareness.

But the feminine and masculine power is so incredibly strong that it 
will emerge.  If any of you are interested, read Carl Jung's works on 
anima and animus.  He observed that men and women tend to live in 
masculine or feminine energy for the first half or a third of their 
lives.  And women could live in the masculine and men in the 
feminine.  But then, around the age of 35 and later, a transformation 
begins to occur which is inevitable for everyone.  Anima and Animus 
want to be together, so the imbalances begin to be renegotiated and a 
person usually embarks on a life-changing journey.  That is why many 
men and women change careers, leave multi-decade long marriages or 
suddenly get married, suddenly decide to have children after clearly 
never wanting to in their younger years, etc.

Tango is an amazing place when transformations occur.  For Argentine 
people who had danced for decades, tango accompanied their life and 
transformations.  Outside of Argentina, people come to tango 
differently, and so tango may be that much more powerful for them.

But the feminine and the masculine MUST be together in the dance.

On another note, men being the predators and women the prey is 
simplistic.  Women want to be pursued and ultimately caught, but the 
manner in which this happens makes or breaks the deal.  Women want to 
be hunted, if you wish, but "just so".  So if the hunter is to be 
successful, he will develop his skills in a way that his conquest 
will be successful.  Pure force does not work.  That is what 
seduction is all about - everywhere - in tango and in life.

And the tango embrace is between the masculine and the 
feminine.  When the woman is in her feminine and the man is embracing 
her from his feminine energy, it usually does not feel good for the 
woman.  When a woman embraces the man from her masculine power, it 
usually does not feel good for the man.  If people do not take care 
of the embrace, they are missing an opportunity to seduce his/her 
partner into a tango that they may remember for the rest of their lives.

Warmest regards to everyone,

Nina

How well said, Nina !!!

And if a woman and a man are powerful, in the dance they enjoy their power !

They multiply their abilities feeling and feeding on each other.

Nina touched on Feminism, the movement in the US of re-balancing the gender power structure. I agree with her, that there's no question that it was "much needed." However, like pendulums tend to do, IMO the pendulum of gender relationships, with the impulse of Feminism, has swung back past center in some situations.  I'm sure I'm not the only tango instructor who has seen cases of a couple coming to learn tango, with a strong and powerful woman, exerting her power and control over the relationship, and a sensitive and caring man, giving in to his woman, letting her have the power she (or her mother) had been denied, effectively letting her "lead" their relationship. Couples like this often drop out of tango almost immediately when they realize that this dance requires a complete transformation of their attitudes and concepts of gender/self, at least in order to dance tango, but fearfully perhaps extending to their partner and other relationships as well. 
 
Conversely, I have seen couples embrace the opportunity that tango presents, and courageously undergo the long and difficult process of nothing less than personal and relationship transformation.  As Nina said, "In a way, struggling and loving tango helps people to become who they truly are and who they were meant to be."-----------------

This is rather more forbidding than my observations and experience 
attest. We can _cultivate_ new ways of learning, perceiving, and so 
forth: we are an adaptable species, even highly so. In fact, some people 
become better dancers, while others become better _students_ of the 
dance and thereby improve more rapidly. (I'm not using "students" here 
to mean "perpetual" or "mere" students... I use it to mean "one who 
continually studies the dance," as an actor-scholar of Shakespeare might 
also be called a "student" of the bard.)

Agreed. And yet one can try to help students cultivate an understanding 
unique to tango. I find that when a student suddenly "clicks" (and all 
of us do, at numerous times), it's because they've understood the dance 
in its own terms, rather than by reference to something else (e.g., 
yoga, sports, grammar, bicycles).

In short, to overemphasize where someone starts is for me a little too 
deterministic, and also lacks adventure. (This is also an abstract, 
quasi-philosophical point with me generally.) But it's also just honest, 
at least when I speak for myself, to say that learning the dance 
requires some adapting and growth as an individual.

Perhaps I merely emphasize the other end of the equation, though.

Hey list,

While I did enjoy reading much of what was in Nina's post, I want to 
address the thread-starter here, because I think it's a case of a 
pendulum "swinging past center"-- or in other words, overcorrection.

Razor Girl wrote:

>   
Agreed. I sometimes see women sulking or looking stony/bored/whatever, 
and it hardly encourages me to invite them to dance. A foul or 
indifferent mood is not exactly attractive, and when I see it, I keep my 
distance-- that being perhaps the intended result anyway.
> 2. The follower is in control of the dance. [...] Also, the way in which she interprets the lead is her choice, so as a leader you have to be aware of and open to the possibilities she presents.
>   
I've read other statements to this effect recently, and I have to disagree.

If a woman is going to "interpret" my lead with too wide a berth, I 
can't enjoy the dance. Moreover, she's liable to miss half the 
expressive content of that lead, and that's not quite what I consider 
her "agreement" to follow me.

Ultimately, WE dance, if things work. If she starts getting airs about 
freedom, which conflict with cooperation, the dance doesn't work. Her 
only choice (and mine) should be to dance with each other, not despite 
each other. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the dance isn't about 
freedom at all... rather, it's about liberation from the need (or 
desire) for it.

It's my opinion that to introduce notions of political/civic equality 
(or otherwise) in the embrace-- where they really don't belong-- is to 
miss the whole point of tango.
> 3. The follower has an extremely influential role in the expression of musicality.  Her timing, responsiveness, and the manner in which she executes the movements which are lead are all completely her responsibility.
Yes, but let them not become her irresponsibility.
> Also, the spaces in between what you lead are hers to play with.
>   
Those spaces are in some cases called "cortinas."

A man who can lead (and listen to) his partner with continual attention 
doesn't deserve "interpretive departures" as payment for his care. If 
he's really with her, he'll sense that the dance needs a pause (or what 
have you) at the same time she does, if not before. And if they're both 
following the music's "lead" in the same way, it's rather a moot point.
> The best dances happen when both the leader and follower are striving to make the dance delicious for the other person while confidently expressing their personal uniqueness in a warm and trusting embrace.
Exactly. Except that you (ideally) leave behind your separate self when 
you enter the embrace. Each embrace has its own chemistry, and is its 
own creation: we become something different with every partner, even if 
the differences are slight. If you bring luggage along, with your name 
in big letters on it, the whole thing sinks.

These are perhaps illusions or ideals, but we cannot dance well without 
them.

Brilliant!

Nothing cripples me more on the dance floor than a woman
who needs me to take care of her. 

Perhaps the only thing worse is the man who wants to "take
care" of the woman. He needs a dependent woman. He is too
weak to face the Goddess.

There's a young woman in our tango community with tatoos in the shape 
of the sound holes in a violin high up on her back between the level 
of her navel and her solar plexus.  Not the usual stereotype at all.

I find the symbolism fascinating.  I'm resisting the impulse to slip
into pedant mode and analyse it from the view of chakras and higher
vibrations and musical instruments and all, but I will say that I 
find myself automatically wanting to dance with the utmost finesse 
I possess when I work with her in class.

It's as if she's saying, "OK, I'm here to be played, but you better 
do it with the seriousness and skill I deserve".

     Being somewhat of a violinist myself, I must say
I am equally intrigued.

     Oh really?  Were I in your place, I imagine I'd

pizzicato on her G-string.

This is really great Razor girl.
Thought I would toss something out and see if it flies and compliments what
you wrote.

This is really simple folks.
When you dance with another, regardless if it is Man or Woman/ Lead or
Follow/ Predator or Prey/ Weak or Strong/ Masculine or Feminine/ someone
with a nice hair style or a shaved head.

The dance of tango has the potential to manifest all these things that have
been mentioned and a whole lot more.
It does not mean it is going to.
This folks, can make the dance really hot.

Hi everyone,
 
I haven't written to this list in a long time and also I apologize if I am
taking this out of context or anything but I had to pipe in when I saw this
statement from (I believe it was) Dani:
 
"The man is the predator, the woman is the prey, as has been since time
immemorial "
 
First of all, I am not going to argue that the above statement might be the
opinion of some.  But I think it's a really narrow minded way of looking at
the complexity of the relationship between men and women.  And it inspires
me to address what I often find to be a misconceived view of the
relationship between the leader and follower in tango.
 
Sometimes I have found that men get on these power trips about leading and
neglect to acknowledge the true fact that the follower has an equal amount
of influence on the dance and that it is truly a partnership.  Even the most
machismo men can not deny the powerful role of the follower.
 
Here are a couple of things to consider about the role of the follower and
her power to influence the dance:
 
1. It is the woman's choice who she dances with.  She allows herself to be
approached or not, she selects whether or not to catch a man's gaze.  I
would go so far as to say that most of the time it is really the woman doing
the asking with her posture and eye contact and not really the other way
around.
 
2. The follower is in control of the dance.  Without someone who has agreed
to follow you, there can be no lead.  There is nothing "prey"-like about
this and it is a completely conscious and active choice on the part of the
follower.  Without her trust and response your lead means nothing.  Also,
the way in which she interprets the lead is her choice, so as a leader you
have to be aware of and open to the possibilities she presents.
 
3. The follower has an extremely influential role in the expression of
musicality.  Her timing, responsiveness, and the manner in which she
executes the movements which are lead are all completely her responsibility.
Also, the spaces in between what you lead are hers to play with.
 
The best dances happen when both the leader and follower are striving to
make the dance delicious for the other person while confidently expressing
their personal uniqueness in a warm and trusting embrace.  
 
Be kind to one another. Don't confuse femininity and masculinity with weak
and strong or predator and prey.
 
-Razorgirl

Best thread in many moons!

Usually we see the comments on the great leading ability of Argentine men,
which is generally attributed to either being immersed in the music for
many years and/or being products of the Latin machismo culture.  But
considering this discussion, could it also be the impact of years dancing
with Argentine women?  
In my view, the characteristics described here about good tangueras (i.e.,
awareness of their considerable feminine power, understanding their role in
the embrace and dance), are generally embodied by Argentine women.  (In my
experience, anyone who considers them weak or as prey would do so at
considerable risk!).   

There is often discussion of the impact that a leader has on the follower. 
How much can it work the other way around?  Would it be surprising for a
leader who has the opportunity to dance regularly with the kind of great
followers described here to be a better leader for it?

A well-known American teacher/dancer told us an interesting
story about the first time he learned tango, which was with
Argentine women (his stepfather is Argentine).  He tried to
take his first step, and the Argentine woman he was with
didn't budge.  He felt that it was if she was saying to him
"Boy, if you are going to learn this dance, you're gonna'
do it right."  That memory still influences him today.

So WB, your assessment is probably right.  Add to that that
these men (with Italian influences) were probably trying to
please their mothers first!

More comments are made/heard about the good leaders' role
in part because women like to make men feel powerful and
assured.  So women keep their wiles to themselves.

Rather than relying on references to the superiority of ethnicities and 
other stereotypes in discussing the building of one's dance prowess:

The best method I have seen to teach women to follow (any dance), is to 
simply ask them to close their eyes in partner work.

A. The lead and the move itself has to be mechanically and rhythmically 
correct for them to know what is being asked.  This quickly flushes out 
any balance and axis problems.

B. They won't be able to anticipate.

An 'eye opener' for the man who is used to back leading, as well.  A 
win-win technique.

It's taken me about 6 months to understand why my teacher Florencia 
felt so heavy and reluctant to move at milongas.  She wanted me to 
lead her onto her heel at the conclusion of every step, before 
going on.  To do that, I have to get my center all the way out over 
the ball of my foot.  Otherwise her core is extended towards me, 
but she's being let to step backwards in opposition to that.  And 
she's so honest in her dance she does what she's being led to do 
in that situation, instead of cheating to accommodate me.

I used to mistake that heaviness (some call it compression) for a 
sense of connection.  For beginner men, that heaviness does lend 
some confidence, but but at some point a guy has to move beyond 
that, or he remains trapped in the beginner phase, never learning 
the body control followers who are lighter on their feet demand,
and with his center always behind his metatarsals.

Oh absolutely.  Great followers are those that I find myself doing 
things I didn't know I could do with.

Carol,
Yes, the method you cited is used often for technique and I agree it can be
helpful.  But what I've found most interesting about this thread (thanks
Razorgirl, Nina, et.al.) is that it focuses on roles, not technique.  
There is usually a tendency to discuss techniques ad nauseam here.  It is
much easier to teach/learn techniques than roles.  

On the importance of roles, Jake, who is very often capable of expounding
on technique far beyond the limit of my attention span, made one of his
usual astute observations when he said:  These are perhaps illusions or
ideals, but we cannot dance well without them.

Rather than relying on references to the superiority of ethnicities and 
other stereotypes in discussing the building of one's dance prowess:

The best method I have seen to teach women to follow (any dance), is to 
simply ask them to close their eyes in partner work.

A. The lead and the move itself has to be mechanically and rhythmically 
correct for them to know what is being asked.  This quickly flushes out 
any balance and axis problems.

B. They won't be able to anticipate.

An 'eye opener' for the man who is used to back leading, as well.  A 
win-win technique.

Carol,

I think learning by watching is a basic skill that ALL people have, it's a natural talent, like the learning by doing ;). 
"observational learning plays an important role in aquiring motor skills throughout the human lifespan".
As detailed in the Dec. 20 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience, researchers, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, 
found that when a person watches someone else perform a task with the intention of later replicating the observed performance, motor areas of the brain are activated in a fashion similar to that with accompanies actual movement. 
(see Journal of Neuroscience, December 2006 "Modulation of Neural Activity during Ovservational Learning of Actions and Their Sequential ORders", pdf available on the website).
The important part is the /intention/ of replicating. 

Observational learning is common, but it seems that the skill is better developed in countries 
were people more often practice this, they are more trained to learn by observation. 
The dance teaching in countries like Argentina or Cuba develops observation skills: 
people dance with you and they also  teach you sequences by dancing and having you watch.
People learn a lot just by observing others in the milonga. And it works.
In Germany, for instance, many dance teachers like to disseminate movements and to teach the dance step by step,  
giving verbal explanations of the movements etc. People get used to being served the disseminated dance, 
and they won't digest it if it's not divided in pieces. But that doesn't mean it's the way they are made 
and that they could not change that. Everything can change.

Learning by watching is indeed good for learning the "very same move". 
That's why it's so popular with teachers of preset steps and sequences.

> and learning the technique.

But it is hopeless for learning to actually dance.

The technique comes from the invisible isometrics of body and embrace. 
There's nothing there to see.

Even in the visible outcome, the difference that makes a move feel great 
is microscopic. You can't see it when three metres from the instructor and 
you can't see it when three millimetres from your partner. 

Carol wrote in a later message:

On that we agree ;)

Technique is learnt through not what we see, but what we feel.

Hi, Anna,

I'm afraid I disagree.  It _is_ the way some people
are made.  Not everyone is best served by the same
type of instruction.  Some people learn dance better
by watching, some by hearing an explanation, some by
being guided through it.  Most people learn best by a
combination of methods, followed up by practice. Most
people can learn to get something out of the mode of
instruction which is not optimal for them, but they
have to learn to learn that way.  Good teachers teach
through several modalities when they teach a group, to
optimize the experience for everyone.

Marisa

Yes, but to watch what?  That, I think is where people can
get stuck.  It's interesting to what people see and don't
see as they progress in tango.  At one point after a demo,
they may think "Wow, cool steps!".  Eventually, they may
(or may not) focus more on whether a couple appears
connected or not and the cool steps don't matter.

As been pointed out before, good teachers use a variety of
ways to get their ideas across.  And perhaps this will
spark their students to develop methods on their own to
advance their learning.

On mirror neurons and "learning by watching":

Apparently according to latest research mirror neuron effects are 
stronger if you have previously learned a movement similar to the 
movement pictured, and weaker to non-existent if you have not yet 
learned the movement.

This article supports my claim that only certain people are going to be 
able to "learn by watching," and that it is NOT a 'basic skill that all 
people have, a natural talent.'

It may be so for YOU...but not for everybody, and especially not for 
beginners to dancing.

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3204/01-resup.html

"Research Update
Daniel Glaser's Latest Study With Ballet and Capoeira Dancers

If you're skilled at a physical activity like ballet, the part of your 
brain that controls movement activates differently than the same part in 
the brain of someone who's not skilled in that activity. That's what 
researchers at the University of College London (UCL) have found in a 
fascinating new study. The study has implications for helping injured 
athletes continue to train without moving a muscle, and perhaps even 
helping stroke victims regain lost movement.

In the UCL study, dancers from London's Royal Ballet and experts in 
capoeira, a Brazilian martial arts form, were asked to watch short 
videos of either ballet or capoeira dancers performing brief dance 
moves. While watching the videos, the dancers were lying perfectly still 
in an MRI scanner. A control group of non-dancers also participated in 
the study, which was published in the December 2004 online edition of 
Cerebral Cortex.

The researchers found that areas of the brain collectively known as the 
"mirror neuron system" showed more activity when a dancer saw movements 
he had been trained perform than when he observed movements he hadn't 
been trained to perform. (All the dancers in the study were male.) The 
mirror system in the non-dancers showed appreciably less activity while 
watching the videos than either of the dancers' mirror systems, and the 
response it had was the same whether it was watching ballet or capoeira.

Earlier studies with monkeys revealed that brain cells called mirror 
neurons respond both when we do something, like pick up an object, and 
when we simply watch someone else do it. It was known that these neurons 
fire when we perform an action, but it came as a surprise that the same 
cells also fired when we only saw that action being performed. The new 
study went a step further by showing that such a system operates 
differently depending on what you are physically expert at doing."

Actually it doesn't. It identifies learning as part of the cause, but no 
part of the result. It says

 "the mirror neuron system showed more activity when a dancer saw movements
 he had been trained [to] perform ... "

This means: You can get turned on by watching something you've learnt.

It does not mean: You can get to learn something by watching it.

Hence

 "The mirror system in the non-dancers showed appreciably less activity ..."

does not mean the non-dancer is less able to learn by watching.

Just he gets less turned on by dance. Cue Huck: "No sh*t Sherlock!" ;)

It is a good effect Razorgirl made here..

The message is good but it is not deep enough. 
The question is "How?"

Also I'd like to ask Razorgirl about this contradiction:

In 2 you said: 

".. way in which she interprets the lead is her choice, so as a leader you
have to be aware of and open to the possibilities she presents."

In 3 you said:
 
".. the spaces in between what you lead are hers to play with."

Can you see the contradiction?



I am a little skeptical since I have problems with those girls who
"interpret the lead the way they want" in the way which means "They are not
able to interpret the lead correctly" == Ocho Machine. The first sign of
these under-taught ladies - they are unstoppable.

I do not want people to mistake a mastery of free improvisation dance for
inability to dance with a partner 
I want to believe the Razorgirl message is the first, but it is incomplete,
so the beginners might think that they are free to do what they want (
including bad things ).

What I'd like to say is

(A) She is never free to interpret the lead. Her interpretation of lead
should either support it, develop it further, or contradict it to play with.
In other words - "Communicating". Then it becomes fluent and pleasant dance,
sometime more - a masterpiece. 

( Of course, if there is lead, Gentlemen! Good, gentle, energetic, definite,
precise. Not unclear, grabbing, breaking, sluggish, ripping, cold. But I do
not even want to think about it right now. I am very angry at men. )

Yeah, beginner ladies. Try to interpret the lead "free". You risk to get
left without partners.

There are some ladies who are magical dancers right out of the box without
any classes. But they never interpret the lead free. They do what I've just
mentioned above in (A).

Hi Igor,

Not that Razorgirl needs any defense, but I can assure you she is NOT a
beginner, NOT an ocho machine, NOT distracting in her interpretation of the
lead, and if you ever get a chance to dance with her, I think you will be
very pleasantly satisfied with her following.

On another note, Razorgirl has not posted much lately, not sure why, but in
the past, she has shared some very insightful and helpful observations with
everyone on tango-l.  I think she has a gift for writing and clear thinking.
Let's hope she continues to post her thoughts.

regards

Ed

Ed, 

I never was in any doubt that she is a good dancer and has many friends. It
shows.

I hope I will get a chance to dance with her..

 

So, what would you say about what I said: "A lady is never free to interpret
the lead"  following with my explanation?

 

BTW, I am not against distracting of the lead in ladies interpretation of
the lead. Consider it as a puzzle.

 

Igor.

     The course is actually 550 euros for 20 hours.  550
divided by 20 is 27.5 euros per hour.  By way of comparison,
the classes at the upcoming Moscow Tango Festival are an hour
and fifteen minutes and retail for 30 euros apiece.  But if
you buy a lot of them and pay in advance, that goes down to
24 euros per class, plus they throw in the milongas.  So
27.5 euros per hour is perhaps a bit pricy, but not
outrageous, at least by what apparently are normal European
standards for group classes from traveling professionals.

     The main problem is that a dollar used to be steadily
equivalent to a euro, within a penny or two.  That's where
it was at the end of Clinton's term as US President.  Now,
under George Bush, six years and countless dead bodies
later, it costs $750 to take the same course that would
have been $550, before George Bush decided to ring up the
largest deficit in US history by dumping billions of our
money (not to mention thousands of our lives and limbs)
into his sinkhole in Iraq, making our currency more and more
like toilet paper with each passing day.  But hey, what am
I complaining about, at least I still have all of my arms
and legs.

     So let's not lay the blame for the outrageousness of
$750 on Gustavo Naveira's doorstep, shall we.

I think one of the problems with this thread is the lack of specifics about what we mean by "interpret the lead." I think the "ocho machine" is an extreme that completely misses the point.
 
 
Since the act of leading is a communication, then in one sense, the follower MUST "interpret" it. She must respond, and as automatic and without-thought as that process is in good followers, there still is a level of "interpretation." Her body must "know" or figure out, ie interpret, what the leader wants, and respond accordingly. 
 
 
Any experienced leader can tell you that a given lead for a particular step will elicit slightly different responses in even a group of excellent followers. So how much and what kind of "interpretation" is acceptable? 
 
 
So here's a situation. Two women. One with a personality (at least in the moment) that is a little slow, perhaps she had a tiring day. The other that is spikey and high energy, perhaps she just finished a double espresso. Each of them will respond, ie. interpret, the same lead entirely differently. That has to be acceptable.
 
 
So now maybe one of them is into you as a leader/person, and the other is not. The first might feel like and choose to respond quickly to your lead, "let's get this over with." The second might feel more inclined to lag a bit, to draw out the feeling of the moment. Is this not OK too? She is communicating with you. And since everyone always says that tango is a conversation (which sort of requires that it's two-way), HOW ELSE would she be able to speak her mind/heart and hold up her side of the conversation, if not by such slight "interpretations?"

Thank you Kathryn!

 

Yes, most of them are "undertaught".

To do all the things Razor Girl described, with the few exceptions which are
exceptional ( and usually having  a great deal of experience in other
dances, ballet, or ice skating ), it requires tremendous amount of
dedication to training. She should be able to do things way beyond simple
following and elementary technique, which are a must anyway.

 

It was discussed here before: too many women learned basics, then picked up
something from average ( it means mediocre ) leaders stopped learning
anything. While for the truly advanced dance they need to learn a lot.  It
is difficult for them to advance. They are in this position because they are
followers - it means they are at the mercy of men they are dancing and
practicing with. While a man can choose what to do, what to practice, women
usually can not do much ( remember, she is not on the level we consider to
be high ). Some of them can not even imagine what is there - on high level.
Men can. Some of them dance with genius ladies occasionally. They know what
it is about.

 

Now, here is a question: Who is the best teacher to train women to be
advanced?

 

The one dancing with whom a lady shows much higher level than usual. The one
who is able to dance her beyond her imagination.

 

Igor Polk.

Message-ID: <53522.1185529032@tangohk.com>

 Hi List,

 Recently, Javier and Andrea were in town to teach some classes and it was fantastic. Javier is brilliant. But now, many of the
 girls are imitating Andrea?s left arm position, which is with her left hand low down around the man?s back. You can see it in this
 video:

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTZco_X7shs

 Now I know that it?s the girls? choice, but I find this position very uncomfortable, especially when they put weight on my right
 arm. I also don?t understand its purpose as it also looks uncomfortable for the girl.

 In addition, one of our resident teachers-on-the-dance-floor is telling my beginners to put their left hand in this position so that
 ? ?they can feel his lead?. So now the man is supposed to be leading with his back?

 I know I?m an old fuddy-duddy and lose track of all these modern dancing techniques, so can somebody explain the purpose of
 this arm position. One of the problems with being the dance teacher is that I'm supposed to know everything, so I can't ask
 anyone here exactly what Andrea said in her ladies class :-).

 Keith, HK

The same thing happened after her last visit to Paris.Good thing is, the 
effect didn't stick - once she'd left, the students returned to normal. 
Perhaps because Paris has little of the resident teacher problem you cite.

Whenever I've seen Andrea dance socially (e.g. during the years she based 
her dance school in London), it was with a more regular embrace. Somewhat 
like this:

Your points are valid, Huck, and there's also this:  Gustavo and
Giselle travel with their two small children (who are about 2- and
5-years old) and their baby-sitter.  Whereas generally organizers pay
for the travel of a single teacher or a couple, here they are paying
for travel and accommodation for five!  Of course that has to be
reflected in the cost of the workshops.  The fact that organizers are
still dying to book them is one sign of how important this couple is
to tango worldwide.

Here's another thought for everyone sitting at home in the US or
Europe or wherever and passing judgment on Gustavo and Giselle.  Here
in Buenos Aires, there is pretty much only one class that people who
teach and dance tango professionally will consider going to:  that of
Gustavo & Giselle.  Most of the year, Gustavo & Giselle teach
foreigners both in (excellent) seminars here in Buenos Aires and in
workshops in Europe and the US.  But because Gustavo has been one of
the main forces in tango education here for over 20 years (my husband
started studying with him as a child 20 years ago this November), he
still makes it a priority to offer classes for locals two months a
year at local prices (this year, $20AR per class).  The classes take
place in La Manufactura Papelera in San Telmo and are attended by
about 100 people.  The level of the students ranges from
beginner/intermediate to advanced to international professionals
working in tango for more than 15 years.

In a community where competition is rampant and people are hesitant to
acknowledge each other's skills, knowledge and success, the reverence
with which most of the tango community here in Buenos Aires views
Gustavo is exceptional.

Unlike other dance forms where the 2 partners share co-equal roles in shaping the choreography, in A.
tango, I believe, the leader really does have more control (and more responsibility) in making the dance
fit the music.? The metaphor I use is of a couple out for a drive. The leader is driving, and the follower
is pointing out scenery.? Indeed, that's why they call those moves, at which many followers
excel, embellishments.

But imagine tango without embellishments.? It would be like eating steak without seasoning. Moreover speaking for myself, I can always use a little inspiration when dancing.? I think good followers suggest things that make a dance worth dancing.

Dear  Meredith:
Thank you for writing that great post.  I was just about to write adding
to Huck's 
partial defense of the cost, to point out that in a free market
competitive economy, 
sellers can only set prices at the level at which buyers recognize the
value 
of the product or service provided.  If you want the best, you expect to
pay a bit more. 
I also want to add that the reverence for Gustavo is felt not only in
BA, but here in NYC as well. 
I,  and quite a few other obsessed tangonuts I know, and have met from
around the USA, 
take great care to coordinate any trip to BA with either a seminario 
week or at least several San Telmo practicas with Gustavo and Giselle.
-Martin Nussbaum
Ps: Looking forward to your workshops at Tango de los Muertos Boston !

Your points are valid, Huck, and there's also this:  Gustavo and
Giselle travel with their two small children (who are about 2- and
5-years old) and their baby-sitter.  Whereas generally organizers pay
for the travel of a single teacher or a couple, here they are paying
for travel and accommodation for five!  Of course that has to be
reflected in the cost of the workshops.  The fact that organizers are
still dying to book them is one sign of how important this couple is
to tango worldwide.

Here's another thought for everyone sitting at home in the US or
Europe or wherever and passing judgment on Gustavo and Giselle.  Here
in Buenos Aires, there is pretty much only one class that people who
teach and dance tango professionally will consider going to:  that of
Gustavo & Giselle.  Most of the year, Gustavo & Giselle teach
foreigners both in (excellent) seminars here in Buenos Aires and in
workshops in Europe and the US.  But because Gustavo has been one of
the main forces in tango education here for over 20 years (my husband
started studying with him as a child 20 years ago this November), he
still makes it a priority to offer classes for locals two months a
year at local prices (this year, $20AR per class).  The classes take
place in La Manufactura Papelera in San Telmo and are attended by
about 100 people.  The level of the students ranges from
beginner/intermediate to advanced to international professionals
working in tango for more than 15 years.

In a community where competition is rampant and people are hesitant to
acknowledge each other's skills, knowledge and success, the reverence
with which most of the tango community here in Buenos Aires views
Gustavo is exceptional."

The price of this Gustavo seminar is about 3x normal. And 3x the price of 
the last comparable event I heard of hereabouts - Los Ocampos in London.

...are the most expensive European classes you could have chosen. Partly 
due to the 2x festival factor. Not a good example of normal, Huck.

Here's another comparison - round here, that $750 is entrance to 100 
milongas. Regular dancers don't spend that kind of money on a single 
seminar. Gustavo's customers will be almost exclusively teachers and other 
tango workers, including those just buying a CV entry for good RoI.

Hi Chris

G&G have not been in Europe for some years simply because of them having
their second child. 
I think they had plenty of offers which they turned down until their family
could travel again.

Hi Igor,

Here's some food for thought.

What Nina and Razorgirl talk about go beyond technical
skills.  It?s goes to what how the woman feels about
herself, as well.  Her confidence and self-esteem.  Her
belief that she is a partner in this dance.

In an earlier post, Jackie Wong mentioned that although
women advanced faster than men in the earlier stages of
learning tango, they have a much harder time advancing
later.  I believe that part of the reason is their lack of
confidence.  Women who work really hard at their tango also
work really hard at not anticipating, at waiting, at their
actually following and not just recognizing a step. 
Planted in that work is the fear of not being "right", of
anticipating, of not getting the lead.  So she?s bound to
have a lot of self-doubts, even with a good leader.  

>From her early days, she?ll be exposed to guys who will
teach her on the dance floor.  Even the good ones will lead
a step that may make her hesitate just a little.  And he?ll
repeat the step, she?ll feel a bit more confident this time
and do it correctly.  But it?s still a reminder that she?s
not the one in control.  She faltered.  She?s not the
perfect follower, yet.

Getting past these doubts, even with a lot of training, is
hard.  It finally takes saying "Well, here I am.  Take it
or leave it."   It takes a realization that it?s not about
trying to be like someone else or dancing like someone
else.  It?s realizing its okay to dance as oneself, even if
one is not the perfect follower. 

So how does a follower come to this realization.  How does
she decide to take a few risks and try to insert her style
into the dance?   How to become a strong feminine power? 
It takes a partner she can trust, someone who won?t laugh
at her or be mad that she interrupted his step.  She?s not
going to get it right at first.  It?s going to take time
and practice.  This realization, I think, is the difference
between high intermediate women and advanced women - to
dance without fear.

If you watch the pisa, you?ll get a sense of this as people
change partners.  People will dance differently with other
partners.  With some, they?ll feel secure and will become
playful.  With others, they dance "straight", only
listening and responding in body but not in spirit.  It's
not just music or steps they are conveying, but trust.

I find the two embraces almost identical. The small difference probably comes from the more compact embrace they used for the milonga and the fact that the guy is maybe a little bit taller.

This type of embrace is - in my experience - means a strong and quite parallel chest to chest connection with very little to no weight on the man's right arm...if those girls put weight on your arm, they are imitating this quite wrong. The embrace should feel like you have a woman stuck on your chest and a palm stuck on your back. As for any pressure, most milongueras who used this (on me) were not giving me resistance (for movement) just the constant feeling of connection.

I personally prefer (of course: I am not so tall) the type of close embrace where the woman embraces me all around my back, having her palms under my left shoulder. See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCUHZjsHlUo

"It takes a partner she can trust, someone who won't laugh

Igor:

Yes, it is possible to use a partner like that, but it is not enough. He
should have a high dancing power exceeding or at least on the level she
wants to achieve.

Have I mentioned technical training when I was talking about training for
advanced level?
Absolutely not ! Technique - is an intermediate level.

Creativity, ability to build the dance ( and Tango dance in particular ),
ultimate feel of the partner, ability to lead back, ability to dance in
various styles to be able to fit precisely to music whatever it is,
developing beautiful and meaningful movements ( it alone take years ),
developing her own style, charm of the movements, and much more I can not
even imagine now.
Some women have it before starting tango dance ( all of them, actually ),
but then they meet the need to meet a matching partner of great dancing
power..

Hey Gang,

No need to guess or argue about G&G appearances in Europe. The answer is
YES, si si si, they were just touring there this May & June!

Visit www.gustavoygiselle.com and you'll see their recent European &
American tour JUST concluding this weekend in Atlanta, GA with Rhonda &
Manuel, started with Pinot's fabulous TangoCamp this May in Dusseldorf,
Germany. They went on to Athens, Greece, then Tylosand, Sweden, wrapping in
Rome, Italy. They flew from Rome to Nora's Tango Week in San Francisco, CA &
just completed 2 weeks here in Boulder, Colorado with Dance of the Heart's
TangoEncuentro 2007.

They will be returning to Europe (I believe it's Paris, France & then parts
of Tuscany, Italia & possibly more?) this October.

Here's to clarity,

Such a partner is useful for her to find inspiration and
encouragement and to test the final results on.  But I
wouldn't depend on him for training.  If anything, it may
be easier for her to practice these skills on less skilled
dancers.

In the end, she needs to find it within herself, otherwise,
she won't own her tango.

The condescension here towards "less skilled" dancers (whatever that

 From the beginning, she needs to find "it" in the embrace, as does he. 
In tango, there are only co-owners.

The title of his thread now includes the rider "what teacher is better 
_for advanced ladies_"-- although it need not. It might be argued that 
if your head is still preoccupied with levels, you just ain't there yet.

Jake,

Recognizing that some dancers are "less skilled" is not
condescending.  In fact, it can be more intimidating to
work with someone you know is more skilled than you are. 
For women, this can be especially challenging because she
knows that she can cause the dance to falter because of a
missed lead and she'll feel like its her fault unless she
owns her tango.  

If it makes you feel better to substitue "experienced" with
"skill", go ahead.

Lots of men work on their leading with less experienced
women, right?  Same thing can hold true for women
partnering less experienced men.  When it's done right, the
less experienced men are better because of it.

Students, this is nonsense.

In the tango walk, she is balanced on (at least) two feet - one of hers 
and one of yours. Plenty of girls in high heels can do this much better 
than they can balance on one foot.

> They can't pivot if they can't twist while balanced on one foot.

More nonsense. What makes the pivot easy in the dance is that she has the 
guy to twist against. Takes him away and make her balance on one foot, and 
pivoting becomes ten times harder.

> For beginners to practice musicality, they must dance alone. 

Still more nonsense. You can and do practice musicality every time you 
dance musically in a couple. Regardless of level.

Students, a teacher who repeatedly says certain things /cannot/ be done is 
presenting you with a learning opportunity. From seeing with your own eyes 
that those things can be done, you'll learn how much notice to take of 
that teacher.

Trini:
"more intimidating to work with someone you know is more skilled than you

May be, but if so, he is not suitable for her to work at all on advanced
level.
Jake is right. Chemistry is most important. One can discover much more
working with the person with the right chemistry than with someone
intimidating, even if he has a loud name.

I do not like the word "perfecting skills". Yes, Trini, practically any
partner is suitable for that. But I'd like to emphasize again. Advanced
training has very little to do with "perfecting skills". "Perfecting skill"
- that is for intermediate level. Going to advanced level one should have a
set of skills which are perfect to work with: to learn how to create a
dance, discovering new opportunities in the dance.

"Creation of the dance" - that is the goal of advanced level training,
especially when one speaks about "interpretation of the lead by her own
choice"

It is impossible without a great partner who is equally good or more. First
of all it is him who create the dance, at least the generally structure of
it, no matter what women say. Then, in her "interpretations" he should be
able to catch up. Show me an intermediate man who can to it !

Nina said wonderfully:
" in tango, the woman is not powerful if the man is not, and the man's
power is trapped, if the woman he dances with is weak in her power."

Advanced woman's training is impossible without a man who is advanced.

What is training with the less advanced dancer? In reality, it is HIS
training. She brings him up to her, then ( if he is talented enough to move
forward ) they will progress further.

 Chris,

 Instead of constantly criticising the comments of others, please tell us - is there any effective practice or training that
 a leader or follower can do to improve their Tango, other than actually dancing with a partner? If you know
 anything at all about anything, I'm sure you must know the answer is yes, because anyone who is really good at
 anything has spent countless hours practicing and training alone. So tell us Chris, what can we do to improve our
 Tango - other than dancing with a partner?

 Igor and Other Perfect People,

 I must live in a different Universe to the rest of you guys. First we had Stephen with his students who had mastered something
 or other in 6-weeks, now we have Igor who thinks that Intermediate dancers have perfected their dancing skills. All I can say is
 Wow!!  Truth is, as Stephen eventually said mastery actually means something less than mastery and Im pretty sure that Igor
 will agree that perfect actually means something far less than perfect. Why use words so loosely that they lose all meaning?

 Im reminded of when I attended a Ballroom demonstration by Andrew Sinkinson who, although he never became a World
 Champion, was recognised by many as the master of the Foxtrot. A basic figure in the Foxtrot is the Feather Step and
 Sinkinson told us that his greatest regret was not failing to become World Champion but that, after 30-years of practice, he
 had still failed to master the Feather Step.

 Im also reminded of a recent article that reported on a comparison of test results between Asian and American children. The
 Asian kids scored higher, as they usually do, but when the kids carried out a self-evaluation, they evaluated themselves much
 higher than the Asian kids did. In kids, this kind of confidence may be good, but for adult tangueros, striving to be the best that
 you can be, I dont think so. 

 What Im getting at is  WILLYOU PEOPLE GET REAL! Igor, Stephen, Im absolutely certain that theres not one person on this
 List who has mastered or perfected any aspect of Tango. And, if there is, show us what it is you that youve mastered or
 perfected and I guarantee someone will show you someone doing it better. And Im equally certain that the really great ones
 will never accept that theyve perfected anything but will always be striving to improve. Many people on this List just think way
 too much of themselves or evaluate themselves far too highly. And I think most of us know who they are.

 Keith, HK

Take him away and make her balance on one foot, and > pivoting becomes ten times harder.----------------------- A recent advanced class with Alex Krebs identified two different types of embrace, with completely different results in enabling the woman's pivot. In one, the embrace is firm, and this is what Chris is assuming, as she indeed has her leader to twist against, to provide the counter torque. But Chris, this is not the only possible embrace. In a very loose embrace, the woman must indeed pivot on her own power. And you're right, it is "ten times harder," mostly because it requires excellent balance, proving the validity of Trini/Sean's statement. OTOH, the statement is a little absolute to be completely true IMO, but what I believe IS completely true is that the better they can twist while balanced on one foot, the easier they can pivot, regardless of how much or how little they're using their leader to provide the torque power (since embraces are usually somewhere in between the idealized extremes of "firm" and "loose.")

We'll have different opinions on that.  After all, you
wouldn't always know if a woman is practicing something on
you or not unless you asked her or she told you.  

Jaimes Friedgen, who is a wonderful dancer and is
absolutely great about encouraging women to play and
suggest movements, gave me this tip during a private
lesson.  He said that if I suggest something and he
notices, then I did it wrong.  (Of course, if you think I'd
spend all of my time working on this with Jaimes at a
milonga when I only get to see him once or twice a year,
then you're nuts.)

Keith,

I wonder, do YOU have some skills which you can tell you are perfect with?

Ok, Ok, it take "perfect" back. "Good enough".

If you can not say that some of your skills are "good enough" what a dancer
you are then?

"Advanced dancing is not about "perfecting skills", it is about "creating

I hope Keith, you do not think that I call "not perfect you skills" at
advanced level. I only say this is not most important.

Thinking that mastering Volcada and Colgada you jump to advanced level, you
make a grave mistake. Which indeed cost you a lot of money and time.

Regarding my dance - I'd be happy to share it with anyone at Denver soon.
Please, let us dance together, I am new at this event!

And of the "girls" that can balance using me as an assist, I 
have yet to meet one that dances well.  

Using me for balance means I have to have balance for 2 people.  
Up to a point I can fill the need.  But I consider an act of 
generosity and/or friendship.  I always counterbalance it by 
seeking out a partner who can stand up by herself.

In any case, advocating using the man as a crutch is demeaning 
to both men and women.  I'm not a day laborer, and they aren't 
frail helpless things.  As hard as I work on my dance, they can 
at least get this one thing handled.

Given correct posture and technique it's effortless to pivot
on your own.  

Sure it's easy to twist against the guy.  But it's hard on 
the guy.

<sarcasm>
Yeah, I saw a beginner practicing musicality the other day.  He 
fell on top of his partner, but he did it on the music.

Call me an elitist prick, call me whatever , but I don't get

 Chrisopher is right.

 Chris, UK doesn't want girls to take classes, he doesn't want them to practice and he doesn't want them to
 improve. Why? Because then the girls have to be dependant on men like Chris to show them how to dance.
 We see it all the time - men who grab a beginner and show the girls a few moves to demonstrate how
 clever they are. Of course, it's pathetic. But I guess that's how Chris gets his kicks.

Keith, do you get really good at sex by hours practicing and training alone?

Or friendship, marriage, parenting, counselling, coaching, negotiating, 
teamworking, managing, politics, government, business etc. etc.?

Or teaching tango?

Of course not.

Dance with many partners.

Chris's advices are very good, please, do not understand them too
simplistically, do not underestimate it.


1. In the tango walk, she is balanced on (at least) two feet - one of hers
and one of yours. Plenty of girls in high heels can do this much better than
they can balance on one foot.

This though is deep. Please, do not absurd it.

2. What makes the pivot easy in the dance is that she has the guy to twist
against. Takes him away and make her balance on one foot, and pivoting
becomes ten times harder.

When he pivots her, it is very "tasty". Both are the requirements: knowing
who to twist and pivot herself, as well how to let to the guy to pivot her.
And any man should be able to pivot the lady. ( I don't know, it is so
obvious, just for the sake of completeness. )


3. You can and do practice musicality every time you dance musically in a
couple. Regardless of level.

That is called dancing - practicing musicality. And that is what gives much
more dancing power than practicing anything else.


4. Students, a teacher who repeatedly says certain things cannot be done is
presenting you with a learning opportunity. From seeing with your own eyes
that those things can be done, you'll learn how much notice to take of that
teacher.

Chris,

Keith is right and your comments are nothing less than a gratuitous put 
down. Keith is not talking about sex or working on relationships. His 
comments are valid. Tango movements are like gymnastic movements or like a 
sport or a even playing an instrument. To gain skill in those things, 
practice is invaluable. Yes, people do practice those skills by themselves. 
Even boxers or martial artists practice and train by themselves even though 
the end results involves another person..... If you have nothing but 
negative comments or personal attacks to contribute, your participation in 
these forums is not helpful and frankly, it's rather discouraging and brings 
nothing but discord and hard feelings. Is that what you want?

I'd like to give you an excellent example of practice, I think.

About 5 years ago I've attended a workshop of Gloria and Eduardo.
I've recorded and then reviewed one of their "advanced" elements which I
remember I could not do no matter how hard I tried at that lesson.

I reviewed the record many times, tried couple of times - it did not work.

On this Thursday, dancing, right in the dance, I somehow recalled this
element and tried to do it.
It went wonderfully !!!

What I want to say, it will come. I was moving forward, and then the day
came when I was able to do something which was difficult for me. I never
really practiced it, I only moved on with other things.

So, it will come itself, when necessary skills and the basement is build.

Did I practice myself? Yes. But not IT.

There is always something which one can practice alone to the full extent.
And dancing is one of this activities. One does not need a partner to dance.

I think Chris wanted to say that without actual couple dancing one can not
progress in tango in particular no matter who hard one practices alone.
There is something there which can not be practiced alone and this thing is
very important.
As with everything else practicing is important for progress, but the main
activity is more important.
And without the main activity how can one know what to practice!?

Igor Polk
Keith, HK,
It seems to me you oversimplify things. 

Can YOU "grab a beginner and show the girls" how to dance? You think it is
so easy?

Sorry, for too many messages,
Can not hold myself - it is so interesting logical practice ( and not alone
- in public ! )

For example, let us take 2 gentlemen.

One is practicing as a hell, ocho-ing, pivoting 4 hours a day, punching a
bag from dusk till down. But never going to actual place of meeting..

Another one - never practices himself. He only dances with girls the way he
can and/or is participating in street fights once in a while.

Two extremes.

I guess you already guessed my question and answered for yourself who is a
better tango dancer and where it is better to dedicate time if you have too
little of this asset.

If more men were as good listeners as they say they should
be, then this wouldn't even be an issue!  And tango
conversations would truly work both ways.  But alas!  Based
on my experience, I'd say it takes men at least 20 years to
develop really good listening skills.  Not that that is a
criticism.  It's just a reality check.

Hi Igor, Sean here.

Neither is the better tango dancer. The better tango dancer
is the one who does both! I am surprised that you cannot
figure this out. Especially since I already told you the
answer when I started this thread. It is about "Effective
Practice". I am sorry it took you 5 years to figure out a
move that you wanted to learn. Clearly your methods are NOT
effective.

In another post you asked Keith if none of his skills were
"good enough". I won't speak for him, but I suspect his
answer would be similar to mine, which is no. There is no
"Good Enough". Every skill will be improved, for the rest
of my life. Perhaps you do not understand the phrase "Good
enough". As you have used it, it means "mediocre". And that
is never good enough.

Sean

Perfectionists !!! :)))

It one letter you say it take at least 20 years ( based on Trini's
experience. With you, dare I ask? ) it takes for a man to develop listening
skills.

In another you blame me that it took me just 5 years "to figure out a
move that you wanted to learn". Mind you, it took me 5 years not of
practicing it ! But accumulating enough skill and knowledge so that the move
HAPPENED ITSELF. And other things. And of course, I did practiced. Something
else. 

I think, this discussion is quite pointless without specifying what skill,
what move to practice.

Mediocre does not mean "good enough". It usually means "not good enough".

Contrary to what you say, there is no "Perfect". But "Good enough" exists.

And that is wrong too. Perfect things are everywhere. Every art piece is
perfect.
Haven't you ever experienced a perfect dance?
I am sure you did.

Igor.

Chris, why am I not surprised that you didn't answer the question. And if the answer is "no, there is nothing you can do to to improve your Tango, other than dancing with a partner", please say so. I'm assuming you don't mean 'dance with many partners at the same time'.

Your reply just make you sound even more ridiculous. OK, you got me on the sex, friendship, marriage and parenting activities, although all of those activities might well be less tramatic if a little research and book-learning were to carried out as well. Lots of reputable books are available on how to make relationships work, although I must admit I haven't read any. And, who knows, a solitary study of the Karma Sutra might work wonders for your sex life.

But all the other activities you list - counselling, coaching, negotiating, teamworking, managing, politics, government and business normally require some kind of qualification before you're let loose on onother person. Or do you think that councillors, coaches, negotiators, etc. just walk in off the street and learn by doing?

Maybe I shouldn't be dignifying your idiotic non-answer with a response.

Keith, HK

Yes I can Igor and yes, I do think it's so easy. And every good dancer on this List can do the same. Unfortunately,
for every good dancer who does this, there will be many more bad dancers who will try to do it and mess up the beginner.
Sometimes, they mess her up so badly, she leaves and never returns. I've seen it happen to my own beginner
students and that's the problem. And, for the record, I'm not talking about loss of income - I'm talking about the loss
of a potential tanguera, the possible loss of many hours of delightful dancing with a new partner - all lost because 
some jerk dragged her around the dance floor and made her feel like a fool.

 Igor,

 What is happeneing to you - are you on drugs? You've always been a little eccentric, but the English quite like eccentrics. But
 now your blathering like an idiot. 

 Lets take a 3rd gentleman. He dances with a partner as much as possible - whenever he has the opportinity. But he wants to
 progress more quickly and, when no partner is availble, he practices alone. He walks endlessly, backwards and forward,
 concentrating on correct footwork, style and posture. He improves his stability and balance by pivotting endlessly. He becomes
 so good he can do a triple-360 pivot forward and the same backward - in either direction, without even a wobble. He becomes
 an expert at the Lapiz - again, a triple turn is nothing to him. He also practicises all the followers steps - Front and Back Ochos,
  Giros in either direction, embellishments - anything he can think of. He studies possible combinations and dances them alone.
  He practices until he has the body and the muscles of a trained dancer. But still - if a partner is availble, dancing with her always
  comes first. And, always, night and day, dancing, practicing, eating, driving, making love - he listens to Tango music until he knows every 
 orchestra, every tune, every song. He can hum and sing along to all of it.

 So, Igor, which of the 3 gentlemen will be the best dancer?

 And, Chris, UK - do you have an answer?

Hi Igor,

I'm sorry and surprised to hear you say that 'good enough' exists. 

I agree with Sean when he says .... "every skill will be improved, for the rest of my life". 

Igor, there's no such thing as 'good enough'. Of course, the day will come when age causes some physical skills to
deteriorate. But many of us will never conciously accept it. And, hopefully, other, even more important 
skills, will continue to develop and improve to balance things out and our dancing will continue to improve.

But, whatever happens, never, ever think that anything is good enough. Keep working to improve. If you 
don't, you'll find yourself going backwards and all the young bucks will be taking your best dances.

Keith, HK

any recommendations / reviews on the milonga on these

Paris (from the 12th to the 19th)
Amboise (from the 20th to the 23rd)

Also, this seems to be a calendar for Paris.
Are there any other calendars? In English?

 I recently DJ'd a Milonga and had a separate screen displaying an image
of the relevant band/singer.
 This was done manually and, as most Tandas were by the same,
singer/band it was not too difficult.
 The concept was well received by the dancers.
 However:- 
 Does any one know of software that will match images to music.
 So that when you play a piece of music the relevant image, which you
have connected to that piece, will automatically display.

Message-ID: <20070730142957.D8A1E2352AC@p3fed1.frb.org>

Hi Everyone:

The goal of practice is to become more effective at dancing.  Practice may 
be helpful, but only if it is done in a manner that is consistent with 
effective tango dancing itself. 

What are the elements of effective social dancing?  Such dancing cannot be 
reduced down to a set of mechancial skills.  The embrace, the relationship 
with one's partner, the relationship with others on the dance floor, and 
the relationship with music are the context within which we dance tango. 
Practicing by oneself may help develop some mechanical skills, such as 
balance, musicality, knowledge of step patterns, etc., but they also 
remove the entire context of tango.

Practicing with a partner improves matters considerably because it is 
closer to dancing.  Practicing in a room full of others improves matters 
even more but it is even closer to dancing.  Some might go even farther 
and claim that practicing at a milonga is even better, but it is 
reasonable to recognize that social norms separate practice and social 
dance.

Tango is a dance in which is it easy to become obsessed with perfection. 
The taste of heaven that is found within tango may encourage some to seek 
perfection.  Others may bring their own perfectionism to tango.  But we 
should never confuse heaven and perfection.  They are very different.  The 
path of perfectionism often leads away from heaven--as we find ourselves 
accompanied and driven forward by demons (aka a monkey mind) that become 
quite familiar.  If we pursue perfection in our practice, we are likely 
developing the demons that seek to keep us from effective dancing. 

In tango, heaven is found through the simple gift of grace.  That comes 
from getting out on the dance floor with the person that happens to be 
right for the moment, opening one's heart and falling in love again.  The 
times that this happens, one is just happy to be in the arms of another at 
the end of the tanda.

Many blissful tangos,
Steve

Jumping in here as a trainer, Manuel is quite right. The limiting factor 
in tango, much like music, is neurological. You must repeat patterns a 
great deal to cause growth in the neural pathways until you can 
internalize the movement. This will vary by individual and various 
factors such as background (gymnasts, e.g. will pick it up faster than 
many others), amount of practice and quality of practice. One of the 
most effective things you can do it think thoroughly about whatever 
movement you are doing because we know that this will prep the pathways 
and make the motion easier. For activities that have a large 
conditioning component - which tango thankfully does not - it can be a 
great deal more frustrating since you have to grow new muscle before you 
can train it. One study showed that for largely neurological activities, 
visualization was almost as effective as physical practice. This is why 
a lot of martial arts have passed down such meditation techniques. They 
cannot articulate (in a Western setting) why it works but they know it 
does. The fact that their explanation sounds to our ears like 
mumbo-jumbo does not reduce the effectiveness.

     Alas, I can't help you with regard to what you are
seeking, but I just wanted to heartily thank you for the
effort you are making to help us dancers who want to
further educate ourselves about orchestras, singers, and
song titles.  It would be really great if all DJs did this,
even if an elaborate projection screen was impractical,
and it was just plain lettering in a large font on
a cheap video monitor facing the floor that dancers who
wanted to could read as they danced by.  But as you say,
unless a DJ wanted to type the info in by hand each
song (which would soon get to be intolerably tedious),
you'd need software to automatically lift those fields out
of whatever the mp3-playing software the DJ was using,
and display it on the other monitor.

If anyone uses a mac with iTunes, I've made a screen saver that does just that.

Contact me if you would like me to send it to you.

This is possible with iTunes.

Under iTunes there is a third party plug-in called Cover Version which 
will display cover art on the iTunes window while the track is playing. 
So you can set up a playlist, start the playlist, turn on the 
Visualizer, set it to fill the screen. If you have a projector linkup 
you could send this image to a projector and project it large at the 
venue onto a light wall or onto a conventional screen.

iTunes allows you to cut and paste cover art or other jpg images into 
the cover art field of the track library. (Some tracks may be locked 
into the actual cover art if you bought them from iTunes (I think that's 
a bug) but most will be editable and you can put in whatever art you 
want). I frequently use historical images of artists (or any artistic 
dance image I like) rather than the album cover.

My experience is on Mac only--not sure with Windows versions of iTunes.

Of course, just because software allows this to be done (or because you 
can do it manually) does not mean you do not need a license to project 
or display certain artwork at a public venue synched up to music. In the 
US, this type of use requires a music synch license. Most commercial 
venues with music (bars, theaters, etc.) will have a typical ASCAP 
license for their venue for recorded or live music, but many will not 
have a synch license for recorded or live music synched with images.  To 
stay legal, as a DJ you have to check with how the venue is licensed and 
make sure that use is covered.

Thanks Jeff. This is a key element that I neglected to
address. To practice effectively, you have to be mentally
focused on the skill you are practicing. So it is less
effective to practice two or more skills at once. This is
why I believe that dancing cannot be considered practicing.
For me, dancing requires awareness of everything. (Being in
the moment, in the zone, or however you wish to describe
that state.) If you are focused on improving one thing,
then you are not giving enough attention to everything
else. (A perfectionist's ideal may be to maintain total
awareness even while focused on improving a specific skill,
but that is a different discussion. Besides, I am more a
pragmatic than a perfectionist.)

How large is large? With your background, the strength
required for tango may seem insignificant, but that is not
true for someone with a sedentary lifestyle. The average
person does not initially have the strength to balance on
one foot, to maintain their axis, or to create the torque
necessary to lead certain movements. Most of our students
have to train both strength and control.

 From a strictly coaching perspective this is dead on the money, 
otherwise sports would have no practice, just games.

More to the point, practice allows you to over-optimize certain parts in 
an artificial environment. This is essential because any high-level 
physical level activity should be viewed as more of an interacting 
system. Soccer players don't just run, e.g., but practice sprints in the 
case they need them. Generally any skill in a live situation will 
degrade so optimizing them is crucial. So it goes with tango.

With tango you can work at it a couple of times a week and after a month 
or two be doing pretty well. Sure you'll be a bit sore in odd places but 
nothing serious. Contrast this with a competitive sport where an athlete 
might well have to do 4 - 6 weeks of serious free weight training before 
going to an intensive camp. Anything less is begging for an injury. I 
know I sound like a trainer/coach but wanted to emphasize one of the 
charming things about tango: most anyone can do it! But you have to know 
*where* you put your practice. Having someone offer "tango-robics" would 
be goofy in the extreme, wouldn't it?

Cheers,

Jeff G

'Internalise the movement' and 'think thoroughly' are not a solution. They 
are a big part of the problem. 

What makes a tango movement work is that you share it completely with your 
partner - you externalise rather than internalise it. And this can't be 
done by thinking, thoroughly or otherwise, because thought doesn't 
communicate across the embrace. The only thing that does is feeling. 
Kinaesthetic feeling.

Not telepathy. Telempathy.

Unconvinced guys, ask a girl at a milonga what's meant by "He's dancing by

     Okay, come on, now you guys aren't being fair.
Chris, just because someone might practice certain
technique (like pivoting) by oneself does not
necessarily mean that one is going to treat one's
parter as an inanimate prop and in effect dance by
oneself at a milonga.

     And yes, Steve, practicing by oneself does
remove the entire context of tango.  So what.  It
isn't supposed to be tango.  It's movement technique
training.

     I agree with you both, obviously one cannot
practice tango by oneself.  But if you feel like it
(I personally rarely have the time, but that's beside
the point), what's wrong with practicing pivoting by
yourself, with the aim of improving your balance and
muscle tone so that your pivots are more elegant and
effortless?

     Compare this to the ballet world.  I've yet to
see a ballet performance where there is a barre in
the middle of the stage, with dancers resting one of
their hands on it while they dance.  Yet ballet dancers
"waste" countless hours practicing at the barre.  Yes,
the context of a ballet performance is missing, but
so what, they're not pretending it's there, they are
simply practicing movement technique.

Thank you Jeff, I appreciate your added explanation. My response to Chris 
was a little too brief but I wanted to get my point across before too long. 
Firstly that Keith from HK was indeed right in his post and that Chris was 
taking cheap shots at him.

Before anyone pounces on my incomplete response, allow me to expand my 
answer a bit. While I agree with Keith and others on the value of practice, 
even solitary practice of tango movements. I don't imply that this is all 
one needs to perfect one's technique. Obviously, dancing with one's partner 
is the best way to practice one's dance and it's the place and time to see 
if all those changes of weight one tried by one's self are working as 
expected when the other person enters the equation.

The one thing that might be misleading (pardon the pun) is the advise to 
dance with many different women in order to perfect one's leading skills. 
Yes, the proof of it all is in the dance floor. All the practice and classes 
mean nothing if one can't or wont dance at the milongas. However, this is 
only the proving ground for one's skill in leading. In order to perfect 
one's dance, to achieve more elegance, timing and perform more impressive 
dances, one must practice with one's partner and not with every woman at 
every milonga. Every dance couple worth their salt spends countless hours 
practicing with each other to get as good as they are.

And by the way, are we talking here about refining and practicing our 
dancing skills to achieve or strive for high competence or perfection? Or 
are we just talking about striving to attain a passable level of mediocrity? 
If it's the first, one must apply one's self to learn, practice and improve. 
If it's the latter, why bother with any of this at all? From my observation 
I can tell that many dancers are already mediocre enough and they could 
indeed just practice their "good enough-ness" with as many women as will 
accept their dances.

Manuel

Oh yeah, speaking of high skill levels in tango and the approach to 
perfection, many people had the excellent opportunity to witness extremely 
high level of teaching and dancing skills exhibited by Gustavo Naveira & 
Giselle Anne here in Atlanta over the last 4 days. And by the way, even 
though some have ridiculed the expression, several people told me in so many 
words the G&Gs performance brought tears to their eyes....

Roger, 

First of all, what software are you using?  Some but not all music
players can be configured to execute a program at the end and beginning
of a song in such a way that you can pass song info to the program.

Second, you're likely to get far more helpful answers on the TangoDJ
Yahoo group than Tango-L.

Hello,

This is just a reaction to something that I take in a generalized way,
i.e. not necessarily tied to the specific context in which it arose
and without negative implications about the need for practice
sessions.

In my opinion Steve's paragraph below manages to capture so succinctly
and eloquently the essence of social tango dancing, along with an
implicit warning against some common pitfalls, that it should be a
"required" reading for all beginners.

With best regards,

Konstantin

     And I guess you get your kicks building silly
strawmen and then bravely slaying them.

     Let me see if I've got this straight.  Chris
rails against the whole concept of teaching, so
you accuse him of being one of those rude idiots
who grab beginners and teach them on the floor.
Yeah, that makes a whole lot of sense--not.

     If there is genuine disagreement on the subject
of teaching and practice, it seems to me you should be
able to find plenty of stuff to take issue with from
what Chris actually writes without having to resort to
making slanderous idle speculation about the guy.

 OK, I apologise if I slandered Chris personally. But the effect of Chris' rants against teachers is the same.
 It encourages those not qualified to teach to, nevertheless, attempt to teach on the dance floor. So,
 even if Chris is not one of the rude idiots referred to, his words and actions encourage them. It also
 encourages followers to learn just by dancing and, as has been stated many times, beginners are easily
 impressed by mediocre dancers and end by being mediocre themselves. Unless, as I said in my last
 posting, they're not driven away from Tango completely. 

 So, who is the most guilty, the mediocre dancers who teach, without knowing any better, or the leaders
 of a community who encourage such actions, whether intentionally or not.

Wow, this is getting exciting.
Kind of like watching dumb and dumber in a film noir style and a tango
theme. Even better with popcorn, beer and humor.
Ladies, isn't the next scene where one guy pops a cap in another and they
have to hide the body while the cynical bought off cop tries to pin the rap
on one of the henchmen lakies.

Boys I will leave you to your talking. I am off to practice.
Gotta make a few of the dames look beautiful during the Denver tango fest,
see if I can also make them hum a few bars of the tune we are dancing to.  

Zorrito.

I would like to thank all the subscribers that gave me advice.
However whilst I was adding plug ins, as suggested, to Itunes, it 
occurred to me:-
You can use the artwork section add the same picture to each piece by 
the same composer/band.
Select all their peices and use "info" to add image.
Then double click on the art work left bottom corner, which brings it up 
a separate window.
This can be moved to a another screen.
Problem solved.
Oh. and yes I will subscribe to the DJ forum.
Thanks

Dude....

I think the fundamental issue here is whether instruction is a valid 
source of information. You imply strongly that it is not. My hobby is 
taking budding  athletes and turning them into supermen/superwomen. I 
know I can do it because I've done several hundred times. You would be 
seriously flabbergasted to see what I can do as well as what I can get 
my students to do. Part of the irritating parallel with both tango and 
martial arts is the decidedly anti-rational approach to it. Since people 
want it to be something transcendental they work hard at putting on the 
blinders to keep it truly beyond comprehension. Sorry, nope doesn't work 
for me but you are welcomed to do so if you like. Just a thought

"War is work, not mystery"

-- old Spartan saying

or more politically incorrect, a quote from Nadia Boulanger, who was 
Piazzola's teacher:

"Art loves chains"

meaning that to truly bend art to your will requires profound control. 
She said that to counter the myth that music just sort of happens. 
Couldn't agree more. (FYI She was a famously ruthless teacher who 
counted Stravinsky, Copeland and a horde of other folks you've heard of 
as her pupils.)

Did I state any place you don't practice with a partner? You stuck that 
in and chewed me out for it. Tsk tsk. Now that you mention it, 
individual practice can be ok but for certain activities it promotes 
more bad habits than it fixes (ever see a wrestler do a lot of solo 
practice? Screws up their timing something fierce.)

Jeff: "War is work, not mystery"  -- old Spartan saying

Yes.
I am not against practicing at all, but..

Tango is mystery, not work. 

Igor Polk

PS. Practicing what makes a mistery mistery might be much more productive
for tango not to speak much more pleasant. Unless you are a sportsman.

The problem is and it is much more difficult. Effective practice is possible
only for advanced dancers - they know what to practice and how. But
beginners need it most. So someone should make a set of excersizes to help
them, but not suppress creativity, inventiveness, sensitivity, reaction,
keeping the eyes open, freshness of the mind, and so on. Practicing the same
move especially with a partner may block all these things especially for
talented beginners and intermediates. Or may not. It all depends how it is
put.

I do not see this issue was addressed before. I do not have an answer, but I
know about the problem, so I'd like you to see it too.

Practicing often, if not always in the current state of affairs, especially
group practice, is about subdiction people to a certain style more than
about anything else.

So effective tango practice may be conducted only by a teacher who knows
variety of tango styles, who is a great dancer himself, who is very
sensitive, creative. Other wise I'd advise students to come to many teachers
with the variety of tango practices.

Igor Polk
PS
One more comparison between war and art of dance. In war one seeks the final
result. When enemy is destroyed, then it comes time for pleasure. In the art
- it is evey millisecond of acting that we seek pleasure in.

Regarding marial arts, the notion is spreading that martial arts teachers do
not actually teach students the art of war. They are carried away with
something else.

What else could it be? A pleasure in the duel, in every millisecond of it -
enjoying spirit and movement. "Look what a great kick I did!". What they are
doing is nothing but DANCING.

I'd like to step away from the abstract terms and suggest a notion  
that we can discuss the principles of "tango" all we want, but in  
reality those are not the principles that guide how we choose our  
dance experiences.

People make ALL decisions emotionally, and then they justify them with reason.

In all dance, I am a technique freak.  I love technique. But I  
certainly do not want anyone wishing to dance with me because of my  
tango. And I certainly will never wish to dance socially with any man  
for technique, musicality, etc.  I am interested in the person.  
Technique is only the means by which a person emerges in dance.  That  
is all.  If there is technique and no person emerges, that is a  
problem.  If the person busts through the lack of technique, fabulous!  
  I'll dance with him if he is interesting.

It is the same for the women.  If a woman is interesting, who cares  
what technical abilities she has?!  There are lots of really boring  
people with excellent technical dance abilities and there are lots of  
really interesting people with lousy technique.  As long as the boring  
and lausy technique do not mix in one person, things are fine.

Maybe people just need to practice not being boring, developing the  
art of conversation and social graces, learning metaphores and poetry  
(preferably in Spanish) and definitely learn to sing some tangos.  And  
then their dancing will be fabulous!

Tango is very, very simple.  I guess we have to get through all the  
complexities and engineering challenges first before we can see this  
simplicity.

Best regards to all,

Nina

Nina,

I will refrain from commenting the "interesting" part before. But the
last quote is interesting. You are basically saying you have to
practice/dance a lot and make a huge effort to understand tango's
simplicity. This simply means that it is in fact not simple. If it
was, everyone could easily do it, and that doesn't happen as anyone
that has tried it knows. Yes, it takes practice as anything in life.

You are roughly saying that quantum physics is really easy after you
have done a PhD on it. Doesn't make much sense does it? :-)

Tango is not easy at any level. But this is exactly what drives
passionate persons to it, to be able to learn a bit every time you
dance and immensely enjoy it as you master it more and more.

Sun Tzu's Art of War was important to teach guidelines and provide
insight into warfare. And I doubt anyone with a brain will claim
warfare to be a simple subject. The few that thought so didn't live to
tell anyone about it. We don't have a Sun Tzu's book of Tango, but we
have teachers to help us guide us in our path through tango. These
teachers can help us from a purely aestetically point of view or from
a more rational one, like the science of having a fit body and mind to
dance.

This idea of anyone being enlightened by tango gods is naive to me,
but I accept that it may be true to some. Yet, their floorcraft has
eluded my observation to believe in them. There is no brilliant
athlete that didn't work hard independently of how gifted it was to
start with. And there will never be a great tango dancer that didn't
work hard: mentally and physically.

my 2 cents.

Personally, I just think we're all just trying to cram the
30, 40, or 50 years it took the milongueros to dance as
well as they do into, say, 5, 10, or 20 years.  Big
difference in starting this dance at age 6 instead of age
30, 40, or whatever.  None of us are getting any younger.

Yeah, practicing...
No, dear !

Don't you think that more practicing to obtain simplicity can be waste too?
When you get advanced haven't you regret about stupid things you so
mindlessly dedicated your time, money and energy for?

Here is an example of upcoming events in San Francisco Area:
( Just received today )

9pm: Lesson - The Dynamic Close Embrace Turn 10pm until ?: milonga
...
3:00pm: The Leader's Ocho
4:30pm: The Follower's Sacada
...
2:30pm: The Overturned Experience
4:00pm: A Colgada Odyssey
...
Another teacher is teaching:

fundamental improve skills "change of direction" turns, "alterations"
& the fluid changes of the embrace. Prereq: 1+ Arg Tango or competence in
basic molinete turns.
..
Learn lead & follow techniques for dynamic Tango Nuevo moves that include
"overturned" ochos, back sacadas for followers & "off axis" turns. Prereq:
at least 2 months of level 2 Arg Tango or the previous workshop.

* * *
Yeah, go ahead, one-year students !
Practice!

You need to re-read what I wrote until you understand why what you are
asking me on your first sentence doesn't make sense.

Your last comment is a typical catch-22. You need to become
experienced to understand what you did wrong/overload. The thing is:
you actually had to do it to get where you are. Teachers/mentors can
help you with this, but not entirely avoid it. Or you could learn
tango by reading a book. And you can't, right?

I don't preach practice until you pass out or anything like that...
each person practices how much she wants and feels like. Some people
may even take an enormous joy in practicing that much... but I do
believe that you will never become a good dancer without
practice/dancing.

Subject: [Tango-L] Rock Step, not.  The Rocking Step.
Message-ID: <16f001c7d3be$7e834e90$6501a8c0@loreenarbus.local>

Nineteen years ago, I was taught "the rocking step" by Orlando Paiva, Todaro, Pepito (for Milonga).


Very simply, the leader and follower are: 1) shifting the weight from the forward foot to the back foot in place OR 2) shifting the weight from the forward foot to the back foot "in place" and turning, counter-clockwise.  It has two very specific purposes: 1) one can "mark" the rhythm, continuing to dance when unable to move 2) when there seems to be little prospect of moving forward, one can aim in another direction in order to be able to eventually move.  Both #1 and #2 help one to not disrupt the flow of movement when in a bottle neck, until one is able to again continue to dance (counterclockwise, of course) the tanda.  



All best,



Loreen

Trini,

The older you get, the better tango will feel for you and look on 
you.  You have to live life - laugh, enjoy, struggle, suffer, raise 
children, burry people you loved, make and break friendships, 
transform, and then transform again.  And then... your feet will 
dance your life and you will be an amazing person to dance with and 
amazing to see dancing.

Warmest regards,

Nina

Quite why you think that's a crime Keith, I cannot fathom. Many good 
teachers encourage it. Not least by giving privates to girls wanting more 
of it than they can (as yet) get in the milongas.

Good question. Let's forgive the mediocre dancers who teach, because, as 
you say, they know no better. The responsibility lies with the community 
leaders who hire them to teach the classes.

Dancing can be a waste too :). 
   
  The fun is in finding. Practicing irrespective of whether it directly helps your dancing or not....is a good thing. You try something...it doesnt work, still you learn!.
  We cannot assume that beginners are incapable of thinking. Let them listen to different teachers/ other dancers with an open mind....work at those ideas.....they will have the answers...they cannot be forever dependent on the advice of others. 
   
  If you want to improve tango: you practice, practice and practice.... Alone AND with a Partner. 
   
  Ofcourse you can just dance with someone [without  any solitary practice]....results depend on the tolerance levels of the other. 
  Just watch people who learnt by "just dancing", and you will see the results for yourself.
   
  Regarding someone's comment that when you practice alone, there is no "tango context":  ...So what?
  You can always find the context by dancing, you aquire some of the *partner independent* skills you may be lacking. 
   
  Whole life we have been taught the virtues of practicing, suddenly we have some revolutionary ideas:). I can certainly see the value of shocking someone into awakening.
   
  So I guess Igor's posting directed against those have the techique, but cannot dance, cannot connect with the partner. That is a different problem, may be there is a remedy....not practicing is not one of them..:)
   
  It is also true that sometimes you have someone practicing and his/her dancing has gotten worse. Remedy i think forget what you practiced and just dance. If your practiced right, the techique you learnt will kick in naturally. 
   
  Please dont ask begginers to stop practicing...as it is dancing level is not getting is not getting any better; also there is a danger that this will increase average level of lazyness ....just when I want to practice something:)). .

Yeah, practicing...
No, dear !

Don't you think that more practicing to obtain simplicity can be waste too?
When you get advanced haven't you regret about stupid things you so
mindlessly dedicated your time, money and energy for?

Bruno,

You are so complicated!:)
I never said tango was easy.  I said it was simple.
It's about the man-woman thing.  Every step and every technical 
detail is about that.

You're quite right, Nina.  I should have said that all the
practicing/training and arguing is our trying to cram the
mechanics of tango into a shorter time span.  One can't
rush the actual living.

It's encouraging to read that a number of people do believe that practicing 
tango dancing is actually a good way to improve one's dancing. I have not 
been able to fathom the logic behind the idea that formal tango dance 
instruction is a bad thing and that people will learn better if they only go 
out there and dance..... I've yet to see a single guy just "go dancing" and 
learn to dance tango (or any other partner dance). Of course, this depends 
on your definition of learning a dance versus my understanding of being able 
to dance a particular partner dance......

I would like to suggest that we start using words in their proper contex and 
with their precise definition or meaning. Otherwise it's very difficult to 
communicate, let alone discuss ideas and thoughts. I'd respectufully suggest 
that we agree on the meaning of words such as mastery, excellence, skilled, 
good, average, adequate, passable, mediocre and just plain bad. I'd also 
suggest that autodidacts are quite rare, particularly when it comes to 
dance.

Another oximoronic concept is the one that suggests that there are dancers 
out there with "all the technique" (I presume they've mastered the 
technique) and yet they can't dance tango...... This argument falls flat on 
it's face. Based on my observation, the only dancers who excell in technique 
are also the most skilled and talented ones. Too often I read bombastic 
fulminations against people who are apparently quite technically skilled, 
yet cannot dance.... This does not agree with reality any more than new 
dancers who've mastered skills of tango dance in six weeks. Perhaps those 
are the same people? Maybe with a few exceptions they are also self-taught?

Everyone of the great dancers I know are highly technically skilled, they 
usually practice a lot and they've all taken lessons from other teachers. 
Amazingly enough, not one of them has ever said to me that they've mastered 
any single step or skill. Without exception, they all say that they are 
always striving to "master" some part or facet of the tango dance. I can 
appreciate diversity and I totally understand that we all have very 
different experiences and even perceptions of the same experience. However, 
we must have a common language and some basic definitions so we can discuss 
our various points of view. Otherwise we might just as well speak different 
languages. If your idea of "mastery" is my idea of "ineptitude" and your 
definition of "high level of technique" is my idea of an "barely able to 
maintain balance while twisted like a pretzel", we are talking over each 
other. Reminds me of the stereotype of the ugly American trying to make 
himself understood in another country by shouting his words louder in 
English....

Respectfully,

Manuel
