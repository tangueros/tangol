Having music on a website which comes on automatically is not only  
poor coding, but bad form, in my opinion.

I suppose you could also say he has a clear agenda, but he also an
art historian specializing in the impact of African culture on Europe
and the Americas, and he provides the referenced to back up his
assertions.   I'm not sure that he could have written the book any

"Local Argentine" would certainly include Afro-Argentines, just as
we consider African-American bluesmen local to the United States. 
When the 1880's came around,  they had been in Argentina for
several generations.

I agree with Thompson.  Something would have evolved in
BsAs, but if you take away the habanera, you never get to
milonga, and without milonga, there is no canyengue, and
by extension no tango. 

Also, the Guardia Vieja owes a formative debt to innovations
of black composers, poets and musicians (Mendizabal, Flores
and Thompson), as well as the habanera.   I think that after
1930 as tango became demarginalized, black influence in
the music was less direct as the number of whites in tango
increased.

This is true insofar as it goes, the Dizzy/Fresedo collaboration is a
major stretch, especially since tango was dying on the vine in '56
under the triple threat onslaught of military governments, rock
music and television.

More to the point were the  ongoing and continuing relationships
of black dancers with the tango revolutionaries El Cachafaz and
Petroleo, as rivals, colleagues and/or partners.

You make a good point about the compatibility of tango and jazz
... both use Afro-derived rhythmic structures, so that's at least a
partial reason why they are compatible.

I can understand stretching a point here and there.  Blatant
dishonesty in the name of circulation is reprehensible.  We
can have an argument about whether Thompson belongs in
that boat, but Howell does without doubt.

What I take away from the book is that the Kongo influences
on tango are direct and essential, and that blacks continued to
provide inspiration out of proportion to their numbers to tango
culture at least up to the end of the Golden Age.

As a example of the same phenomenon in the US, hardly
anyone listens to the old bluesmen in the USA and Great
Britain.  But it's just impossible to overstate the influence
 of people like John Lee Hooker, Muddy Watters and B.B.
King on music here, because that's what all the musicians
used to listen to ...

Same thing for hip-hop these days.  In 10 years, I predict
that the influence of hip-hop will be be pervasive worldwide.
It already is for most electrotango ... just listem to those
stupid drum machines.

I read 3/4 of Thompson's book before giving up in frustration. Is he  
a journalist, a protagonist or an independent semiotician?

That there is African influence in tango is without question. And,  
many of Thompson's photos and documentation are very, very  
interesting. But, in the end Thompson overdoes things. He heaps so  
much information on us that everything just ends up in a pile.  
Inevitably, some of his data is just wrong. If some is wrong, how do  
I trust the rest of it?

I finally stopped reading in a section where he conflates musicians  
and dancers from the 1910s, 1920s and 1940s in a way that doesn't  
make sense (i.e. it was incorrect).

One other example of sloppy journalism: Thompson talks extensively  
about Facundo & Kelly without ever mentioning Facundo's N. American  
heritage (through his father). Why? Because it would be an  
uncomfortable distraction from the African-Argentine-tango line?

And, truly, what does Dizzy Gillespie have to do with Tango. Are we  
all groovin' together because we're musicians, because Jazz is  
universal or because we're black? Or, possibly that was a time period  
when the doors of Argentine nationalism were being opened to N.  
American influences after being closed from the 30s to 55. (World  
depression; Peronism; militiary coup...)

There was american jazz in Buenos Aires, specifically the New Orleans  
traditional sound from the late 20s, but no big band swing. When I  
visited in the mid-1990s the milongas would have sets of "jazz", no  
sets of swing (lindy), and then sets of Elvis & Chuck Berry.  
Following Thompson's stone soup recipe, I guess the Black influence  
on Elvis leads somehow to validating African influences on  
milongueros of the 1950s...

Huh??? I mean to me that is just false analogy.


Other examples of sloppy historical observations:

Thompson traces african postures used in tango via grainy drawings of  
black-argentines. To deconstruct Thompson, how do we separate HIS  
interpretation from the ARTIST's caricature and figure out what the  
SUBJECTS were really doing.

Early in the book, the Thompson the semiotician traces moorish  
influences in tile treatments. That is a example of a symbol that  
carries through history, but just because you see diagonal squares in  
walls doesn't prove the lineage. A , good researcher would need a  
constellation of associated symbols to prove the point.

To be fair, one example that convinces me is the depiction of a  
carnival parade, because in that case Thompson identifies a  
combination of symbols characteristic of the parade and follows them  
through a historical time-line.

Sorry, the link on http://tango-L.com was incorrect for this and it 
confused some people (naturally ...). It was for a private archive

This did bring up a question about passwords (which you don't need for

visit http://www.tango-l.com/mailman.htm -- under "Changes Under 
Mailman" Item 5, the passwords are explained. It will be mailed to you 
once a month, or you can have it mailed to you at any time, or you can 
turn off the monthly password mailing (by visiting your options 
settings, for which you DO need a password ...).

Finally, I have done some fine-tuning so that digests may be larger 
before multiple ones per day are generated.

Also, do remember to make all your posts in plaintext rather than HTML, 
otherwise the list processor will try to convert it for you with varying

How prevalent is the cabeceo at milongas outside Buenos Aires?  Is it used 
in only a few communities, or is it widely used throughout the world?

Do newcomers to tango seem to understand the cabeceo quickly enough?

For those using the cabeceo, does it seem to provide an equal opportunity 
for both men and women to indicate with whom they want to dance?

How would people feel about attending a milonga where it was announced in 
advance that the women would ask the men to dance?

In Phoenix, AZ people typically ask others to dance.

People sometimes ask w/ eye contact, but it is rarer (and more just "for
fun").

How would I feel if women were encouraged to ask men to dance.  Hmm.  Not
quite sure -- I'd have to experince it to decide.

Best,
David

Dear friends
   
  I am looking to connect with leaders and members of Argentine Tango Clubs at universities and colleges around the country and the world.
  The purpose is to establish direct communication among university tango clubs. We have friendly relations among multiple schools already, and are looking for more. It is useful to communicate and exchange experiences with a view to improving student recruitment, lessons and special events. Yale is already in touch with several schools in the region, we carpool to each other's events and exchange useful advice on the specific challenges of running a successful university tango club. 
  If you are a leader or member of a university tango club, or if you know of such a club, can you please send me an email and introduce yourself. If you only know their website that is useful info too, I will contact the students myself.
  Thank you very much, and I look forward to hearing from you.
  Have a nice day

Now this is entertaining;

As far as Cabeceo, it is going on all the time. I have been playing with
this for years, it is just in BSAS they made it as part of the dance.

If it is equalizing, and if new comers understand it quickly, It yes and no.
To really work this it take some awareness and not trying to figure it out.
Remember 80 to 95% of communication is non-verbal.

I can not believe this question has arisen about the women asking the men.

David~

Both links refer to the same location. "www" usually is an innecessary
extra.  Both 'tango-l' are second level domais, as well as 'com' is the
first level domain. 'www' is used to significate a website, but if a server
is well configured is not necessary.

Greetz & enjoy tango!

Indeed, and a reminder of why teaching is so beneficial to tango.

Negative epistasis. Deleterious mutations gathered together in 
individuals are more effectively eliminated from the population by 
natural selection.

My view on learning tango:

"Stay away from self appointed tango teachers."

You are the customer.  Why not just watch someone
dance at a milonga.  If you want to dance like them,
"you ask them" to teach you what they know.  Do not
let people "tell you" that they are teachers.  You
make that decision yourself.

I am interested in finding out about cities, locations, festivals,
particularly near US-NE but happy to hear about any location, where Milonga
is played and danced more frequently at milongas. Where I am (NYC), the
usual DJ protocol is one tanda of 3 milonga per hour, or about 8 minutes
total.  Since I love dancing milonga, this isnt enough for me. Not only
that, but the DJ's tend to play the same 5 or 6 milongas over and over, and
I know from the instructors who visit for milonga workshops and bring their
music (ie Facundo and Kely) there is a wealth of varied and interesting
milonga and candombe out there.  To compund my difficulty, most (not all)
followers here prefer to rest during Milonga and dance tangos, while I
always dance milongas and rest during tangos.  The followers often ask me to
return to ask them when a tango is played, so I'm fairly sure its not my
lack of skill. Some followers tell me milonga is a "guy" thing.  Maybe
that's true, since the traspie requires a nice closer embrace to really
rock.  So, are there locations out there where the women absolutely and
fearlessly love to dance milonga, and where the DJs are willing to (gasp)
shake up the traditional sequences?

How about another suggestion - ask a person whose dancing you admire *where
they learned*. Especially if you are not a professional dancer who can pick
up dances easily. Go to the teacher who has put the most good dancers on the
floor.

Hello list,

I was wondering if some of you could give me advice on where to find info
about tango holidays in Europe that are devoted to Milonguero style.

Trying to come up with ideas for the summer and I'm sure I'll find some good
soul willing to help :)

Thanks in advance!!

I used to do that... until I found the answer was always the same.

"On the dance floor".

As a DJ, I am sensitive to the number of people who choose to dance to 
each tanda.  In many communities where I have DJed, I find myself playing 
fewer milongas (and candombes) at most of the milongas than I myself would 
like to dance to.  I find that I am able to play more milongas at tango 
festivals than in most communities--maybe because the general level of 
dancing is higher among those who have the committment necessary to attend 
a festival.

That makes me wonder if the lack of dancers on the floor when milongas are 
being played may have something to do with a general lack of milonga or 
rhythm skills in the communities where there isn't much milonga dancing. 
Strange as it may seem, milonga classes aren't very frequently/widely 
taught.  And in many milonga classes, the instructors seem to emphasize 
complex movements over rhythm.

In my own community, the number of people dancing milonga increased 
dramatically after a number of us taught very basic milonga classes, and 
that allowed me to play more milongas at our milongas.

With best regards,
Steve

  That's all I can stand. I can't stands no more. 
  Enough already with this distinction between "Teachers" and "wanna be teachers". 
  I say if someone is willing to share their knowledge with you, maybe you could learn what you can from them. 
  It seems to me that most everyone who calls themselves a "teacher" of tango has, one way or another, appointed themselves as a "Teacher". 
  Who exactly, pray tell, decides who is a teacher of tango? 
  Although I have had one (count 'em, one) woman walk away because "you aren't supposed to teach on the dance floor", and have had others let me know either verbally or non-verbally that they weren't open to input, the majority of women who have started to do tango more recently than I have are thankful that someone is willing to explain things to them. And, oddly enough, at the not tango dance venues I frequent, the number of women that are willing to accept input is much higher. There is a selection process going on there of course. Not coincidently, at those other places people aren?t constantly told to beware of people who "want to be teachers". 
  When people share information freely, both misinformation and information is exchanged. So be it. I routinely share the names of those I think are good at teaching with those who seem truly interested in learning, and I certainly hope that people will do "fact checking" regarding what I tell them. 
  It took me into my 30's to know with certainty that all knowledge doesn't come from those we agree to call "teacher" or "professor". I'm not going back.
  And, oh by the way, just last Sunday two different women I dance with shared with me what was basically the same helpful tip. I welcomed this input, and plan to start using it. Were they "teaching"? Call it what you want. Just don't denigrate it.
  Sometimes "the rules" are counter productive.

Hi Steve,

That's funny, I've noticed that most of the time when I get requests for 
milongas, the person who asks is usually a beginner who can't really dance a 
milonga.... The reason more "milongas" are not played in the milongas is 
because people prefer tango and vals. Not necessarily because they are not 
skilled enough to dance milongas, just that they rather dance tango....

I am a self-appointed teacher. Please stay away from me! Thank you very much. 
  If you disregard this warning, you might learn something. Maybe even some milonguero tango, oh, NO!

  PS: In my community, when there was no teacher, I appointed myself teacher, and went on to appoint 10 more just like me. We teach classes for free. If we didn't do it, every week or whenever there's beginners needing classes, who would?

Thanks Steve, Well, then what excuse can be made in NYC, where we have ready
access to continuing Milonga classes by Omar Vega, Armando Orzuzo, Ney and
Jennifer, plus a lot of visiting instructors? Also, in these classes, men
usually outnumber women almost 2 to 1.  I think its a gender gap. Maybe
women just dont hear that primal beat the way men do. (That sexist comment

Yes, in Washington DC festival they definitely played more milonga and other
interesting and unusual stuff. Hope thats the case in Boston this weekend.

Hi Martin
  Well I can tell you the reason why there are fewer women in the milonga classes, it's because women think they know everything and don't need classes. They think, if the dance isn't good it's because the guy didn't lead it well because if he had, I would have followed it well.
  I am a girl, and I lead and I follow and let me tell you, I always used to think as above, until I started to dance with girls and then it hit me there are a lot of bad followers out there, and I have renewed respect for the guys that they can look as good as they do, dancing with them. There are few followers who dance, most just follow, and many badly.
  Then of course, if the guys outnumber the girls in the classes, they are less inclined to keep coming to class, and then the women complain that there are more women than experienced men at the milonga. If there were more women in the classes to learn stuff and to partner the men, and if the women didn't complain so much, there wouldn't be a gender imbalance problem anywhere.
  One guy here, when a girl asked him why he didn't dance with her much anymore, he told her the truth, he said, because you don't bother learning and getting better. Of course next Sunday she came to class. And I hugged him and wished we had more honest guys like him.

Martin,
Come to Pittsburgh or one of our nearby communities. 
Women here love a good milonga dancer.  Much more than
the men.  If you want more milongas, then just ask the
deejays.  When Susana Miller is here Memorial Day
weekend with Diego Vepes, we're having one or two
milonga classes.

Steve,
I agree with your assessment.  If people have a strong
sense of rhythm in their tango, then they are more
likely to succeed in milonga.  I think this is why
milonguero-style dancers are more comfortable with
milonga than nuevo dancers, based on my personal
experience with dancers of different styles.  It
really seems to be in how people hear the music. 
Milonga was always difficult for me until I
continually heard the QQS in tango.

Also, there is a fair amount of alternative music
which one dances more like milonga than a tango.  It's
a nice way of getting beginners used to the moving
faster.

Contrary to Tine,
I think most women are good dancers.
And many many women are excellent.
An 99% of all beginners are able to make a fairly good dance with a good
leader (if not - he is not a good one yet).

I can say only opposite about men.

I think it is much easier for a woman to become a good tango dancer than for
a man, and never the less men are those who want to learn less. And Tine's
example shows just that!

I understand what Tine said. What she said means that those women are not
good enough to be perfect instruments in men's learning. It is difficult to
learn with not finely tuned instrument. They are good enough for dancing
with a good leader, but not good for a clumsy beginner. Because, that
beginner man must know how to follow! Of course, he does not.

I really appreciate advanced women for sharing their time with less advanced
dancers. That is how our community grows and that is how I grew myself. I
can not express in words how I am grateful! That is an attraction and most
important help for tango men.

Fewer women in the milonga classes? That is what supposed to be! I vote for
women/men = 1/10. :)
I believe that is the major reason why tango became tango. Why men should
torture women with their learning? They should practice with themselves or
hire a good teacher to bring them to shape.

But it is a dream, I do not think it will ever happen again like it was in
Buenos Aires.

How to attract men to classes? It looks like it is a real problem. I do not
know. Often girls bring them. May be with time, when Tango gains more social
status, and become less complex ( could  it? ).
Tango definitely has a potential of winning greater social status - you can
not dance any other dance in any place with any music, but you can tango!

I dunnoo...milonga tempo is relentless.
  Its a move/movement monster, need to be fed a lot.
  I think a couple milonga tandas an evening is plenty.
  Hate to score a good partner & then have the music speed up.
  My opinion...

I strongly disagree, Igor. Your posturing only encourages women to walk away 
from their share of the responsability for the dance and promotes the 
"if-you-can-lead-I can-follow" nonsense attitude.

"Maybe women just dont hear that primal beat the way men do."  - Nussbaum,
Martin

What I said in the previous message applies to tango.
In Milonga women really must know how to dance milonga ( it is simple, there
are only 2 rules ( Aha, simple.. ;) ).
A man no matter how good he is can not lead the right milonga, if a woman
does not know what to do.

'I strongly disagree, Igor. Your posturing only encourages women to walk

Yes, Gabriel. If women walk away, tango will die. I am glad you have pointed
it out! And men must do their best to learn, and to appreciate what they are
given by women.
And I am glad to repeat it again: a man can learn from every woman he dances
with! Most women dance and know much more than most men. It is logical too:
they learn from the best leaders. Right in the dance!

Men should learn, men should progress too. And it takes more effort from
them to keep up with women.

I am here to tell more about it.

In the dance everything depends on a man!

He has to: listen to music, interpret it and find the right rhythmical
pattern to convey it to his woman in the lead, to feel her and fix her
errors "back-following", he has to be musical, he has to dance different
styles to different orchestras, and find out what is good for the particular
"her", he has to be creative, improvisational, he has to know how to make
the dance interesting, he has to watch for other dancers, dangers, a safe
place to make a boleo, to follow the line of the dance, not to speak that he
has to move his own legs.

And he has to know how to dance milonga!

See? 10 times more difficult! A great woman can not compensate it, no matter
how good she is!

Do men take 10 times more classes? Do they practice 10 times more? No.

Then women say: "I am dancing and dancing with them, but they are the same
like several years ago! They do not learn! They do not progress! They make
all the same steps. Or they do something which I do not know dancing for
themselves."

And all that time women learned in the dance continuously with the best
leaders.

No wonder women start to lead themselves.


Igor
PS,
I guess the next question could be: "Your posturing only encourages men to
walk away because it is too difficult."

I am looking for the answer myself.

Hola Igor,

Sean here. It wasn't so long ago that I thought just
like you do. But I have recently seen (but not yet
implemented) the wisdom of Tine's observations.

For years I have been one of those guys who always
tries to make my partners feel like they can do
nothing wrong. Many, many teachers have taught me to
do just that. Then last year, a top instructor taught
workshops in Pittsburgh for the first time. He had a
very different point of view. He held me personally
responsible for the burgeoning mediocrity of many
Pittsburgh followers because I make them feel like
they can really dance. He was very insistent that I
stop dancing with intermediate dancers, to encourage
them to improve. He also pointed out that when I make
a mediocre dancer look very good, it is very
discouraging to other advanced leaders who are not so
skilled at compensating for the women's mistakes.
Finally, I also discovered that in order to be always
ready to adjust for the woman's misstep, I hold back
my own intention.

It is clear to me that this guy is right on all three
points. By dancing with intermediate followers, I rob
them of the incentive to improve, I set an impossible
standard for the other men, and I hold back my own
development. But for the most part, I have not been
successful implementing a change. When I have told
women that I don't want to dance with them because
they have not improved in a while, their reaction has
varied in its unpleasantness, but it has never been to
start taking classes again. I hope Tine will also hug
the woman who started going to classes again. I wish
there were more honest women like her.

Sean

P.S.  I particularly like Tine's point about dancing
verses just following. I am sure any man knows exactly
what she means, but how do you explain it to the women
who don't lead? Does anyone have any tips for teaching
women to dance, instead of just following?

What he said.

It is possible for a follower to be essentially useless as a dance
partner.  I've met more than a few.  The worst is when they
think they know what they are doing.  The universal constant
with them is that they hardly ever take instruction, a few classes
a year, and at that, they never took beginner classes.

To summarize, I like how Tom Stermitz defines intermediate:
not taking classes anymore.

The real magic of tango happens with both partners operating
at a high level.  And for followers to operate at that level they
need to work as hard as the leads.

It does not seem I was able to let you understand me,
I guess it is my English.

In my post

"He has to: listen to music, ...."

should this phrase be changed to :

"He should : listen to music, ...." ?

In the sense "Look how many things a man should do!" or still "have to be
able to do to be a good leader"?
I am lost.

There's been quite a bit of writing about dancers not taking classes to improve. Some have written women don't want to take classes. Others say its men.

We really need to step away from the gender complaints and look at it from a people perspective.

I've had this discussion many times with my teacher. "Why would anybody accept dancing terribly?" Well, if you're in a community of terrible dancers, you don't know good dancing so you don't have a basis of comparison.

Not everybody wants to reach their potential. Some are content to dance badly. They don't want to dance well. Their attitude is "just show me enough so I can get up on the floor." Just because I want to reach my potential  doesn't mean everybody wants to reach their potential. 

There are women I won't dance with because it's no fun for me. It feels like I'm driving a bus (before they had power steering.)

Every dancer has to answer the question "Is no tango better than bad tango?" If "bad tango" is the answer, then better dancers are sending a message that quality doesn't count if they continue to dance with poor dancers. When quality becomes more important than quantity, maybe the word will get out that to dance with a better dancer, you have to be a better dancer.

Everybody comes to tango for different reasons. For some, it's the dance. For others, this is where I find my next spouse or intimate other. I remember one man told me that a woman was "auditioning" men to be her boyfriend by dancing with them.

Why don't we just call it straight? There are dancers with a professional attitude "I want to be my best" and there are those who just don't care. 
I remember Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion (the basis for the musical "My Fair Lady.") We can't turn other people into what we want them to be. I stopped dancing with one woman. It wasn't important for her to fix her pivot problem. I couldn't lead her in molinetes. I finally stopped banging my head against the wall telling her to pivot. I just stopped dancing with her. She's not happy about it. I told her to do something about it. She did. She found somebody else!! Now, it's his problem!!

This blunt talk reminds me of the movie "A few good men." Col. Nathan R. Jessep yells "You can't handle the truth." Maybe that's why the better dancers don't tell the truth to those who don't want to improve.

Hmmmmm. It would be almost impossible to find two dancers dancing first time with each other to completely match their skills. So, there is always some negotiation going on at first.

I often encourage pure beginners (I am just an advanced beginner, if there is such a thing) to dance simply but to the music and with the feeling for the partner, the music, and the dance. To me that is more important than any number of fancy steps and figures done without meaning and without substance based in music.

So, the point is that with each woman I dance somewhat differently based on what works. Why would I try to force a molinete, for example, only to give up dancing with her because "she can not pivot" when thousands of variations of a simple walk, which can be easily initiated, can give infinite small pleasures? If I try certain figure and it does not work, I might try it again, just in case my lead was not clear, and if it does not work again I do something else without registering a complaint.

The other day during a practica a lady who is a fairly advanced dancer and I demonstrated how to dance close embrace simply and beautifully (too many people are quick to learn more advanced figures without ever learning to dance). We did nothing but walk, not even a cruzada was involved, not to speak of anything else, just walking with pausing, pivoting, and change of direction through a rocking step. We had a blissful dance to the music and people clapped at the end. Why? I think because they could not miss the fact that the two of us really enjoyed the dance and that alone was infectious.

So, to answer the question in the subject line, what I want from tango is a connection, a pleasure of two people sharing the gift for each other - a dance where both are enjoying it. A nicely danced figure can contribute to it, but is not a requirement.

BTW, I love dancing  milonga.

To Tango well one needs talent, much time and total dedication.
  Many try to emulate, charmingly in their naivete, Tangueras/os whose entire life has been identified with Tango.
  They are bound, inevitably, to fail in their quest, but why deny them pleasure in their failure?

Michael <tangomaniac at cavtel.net> escribi?:There's  been quite a bit of writing about dancers not taking classes to  improve. Some have written women don't want to take classes. Others say  its men.

We really need to step away from the gender complaints and look at it from a people perspective.

I've  had this discussion many times with my teacher. "Why would anybody  accept dancing terribly?" Well, if you're in a community of terrible  dancers, you don't know good dancing so you don't have a basis of  comparison.

Not everybody wants to reach their potential. Some  are content to dance badly. They don't want to dance well. Their  attitude is "just show me enough so I can get up on the floor." Just  because I want to reach my potential doesn't mean everybody wants to  reach their potential. 

There are women I won't dance with because it's no fun for me. It feels like I'm driving a bus (before they had power steering.)

Every  dancer has to answer the question "Is no tango better than bad tango?"  If "bad tango" is the answer, then better dancers are sending a message  that quality doesn't count if they continue to dance with poor dancers.  When quality becomes more important than quantity, maybe the word will  get out that to dance with a better dancer, you have to be a better  dancer.

Everybody comes to tango for different reasons. For  some, it's the dance. For others, this is where I find my next spouse  or intimate other. I remember one man told me that a woman was  "auditioning" men to be her boyfriend by dancing with them.

Why  don't we just call it straight? There are dancers with a professional  attitude "I want to be my best" and there are those who just don't  care. 
I remember Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion (the basis for the  musical "My Fair Lady.") We can't turn other people into what we want  them to be. I stopped dancing with one woman. It wasn't important for  her to fix her pivot problem. I couldn't lead her in molinetes. I  finally stopped banging my head against the wall telling her to pivot.  I just stopped dancing with her. She's not happy about it. I told her  to do something about it. She did. She found somebody else!! Now, it's  his problem!!

This blunt talk reminds me of the movie "A few  good men." Col. Nathan R. Jessep yells "You can't handle the truth."  Maybe that's why the better dancers don't tell the truth to those who  don't want to improve.

Dear friends listeros/as
   
  Here in Buenos Aires, the frequence of milonga tandas is... one tanda, then a 1 hour gap , then another tanda, and so on.
   
  Some milongas dancing places are keeping a non written rule that does not allow milongas dancing places to play other music than tangos-milongas-valsecitos , due to the special status this places have as dancing places , excepted from many of the new regulations for general dancing places .
   
  I noticed , that there is an increasing presence , of special doctored canyengue tandas. I am not qualified to say if this tandas could be considered tango tandas or milonga tandas, since it could be that in the same tanda "Derecho viejo" tango and "Orillera" milonga are included. Now the Tuba Tango group have launched a new CD with a good selection of canyengue and orillero style dancing tracks.
   
  Some weeks ago we went with my wife to club villa malcolm, where the milonga El Motivo helds each second saturday of the month, a dancing night.
   
  It was very interesting to watch a couple that we have seen before, they even have contested into same heat rounds on previous Tango Festivals of Buenos Aires, in the category amateurs. He is a young man, black long hair tied with a string , and she is a middle age woman , thinny and with white hair . They dance quite well the different tandas and they look to enjoy the dancing. 
   
  But when the canyengue tanda came.... they were outstanding , not even they enjoy a lot the tanda, but they do dance in an excellent sincopated walking .
   
  This keeps me thinking on , how do you do when you want to dance canyengue at a milonga dancing place ?? Because you have to wait .. and to wait... until the canyengue tanda arrives , in the meantime you have to dance with your dancing partner just to keep warm :):)

  warm regard

  I dunnoo...milonga tempo is relentless.
Its a move/movement monster, need to be fed a lot.
I think a couple milonga tandas an evening is plenty.
Hate to score a good partner & then have the music speed up.

It's simple, the (broader) community decides who is accepted as a 
teacher. The one who thinks he is a teacher, but doesn't have many 
students, nor regular classes, the one who is teaching during milongas 
is a "self appointed teacher"

No, they didn't teach. They gave you a tip to make them more comfortable 
dancing with you. Teaching on the dance floor is usually done by men who 
are not able to make the woman perform what they want and, instead of 
trying something else or let it be, begin to explain or show them steps, 
also called "verbal leading". They do it usually with beginner 
followers, other followers don't dance with them any longer. The 
beginner followers are impressed that someone "so experienced" cares to 
help them so much. Later they realize it was only bullshit.
>   Sometimes "the rules" are counter productive. 
>   
Yes, sometimes, especially when the rule is not properly understood ;-)
Giving tips to someone you know (longer than 2 dances) is not that 
teaching meant by the rule. Giving tips to everyone, if they want to 
hear it or not, is insensitive and silly.

"Go to the teacher who has put the most good dancers

By your definition, I would be a good tango teacher,
because I have introduced a lot of people to Argentine
tango, and most of them are now great dancers (don't
ask me, ask others about that...lol)....BUT, I am not
a tango teacher.  I just encourage people to have some
fun, and they do it on their own.

I think encouraging people to dance tango often, and
providing venues for them to dance their asses off is
much more important than telling people what to do. 
The Argentines are really great dancers because they
start dancing tango when they are 6 years old, and
they learn it mostly from their close friends.  They
have their own tango.  Argentines do not look like a
teacher.  That is bad. They look like themselves. They
are individuals, not programmed robots.

--- Lois Donnay <donnay at donnay.net> wrote:

" How about another suggestion - ask a person whose
dancing you admire *where they learned*. Especially if
you are not a professional dancer who can pick up
dances easily."

I have found that the really great Argentine tango
dancers, usually have little professional dance
training, and they have learned Argentine tango from
their friends.  The people with professional dance
training are usually the problem on the dance floor in
Argentine tango.  They are usually quite stiff and
rigid. They always try to "look good" and execute the
perfect step, but they do so usually without following
the music. They have a hard time with improvisation,
and prefer to do preset choreography.  The women often
back-lead the men, if they get a chance. They usually
only dance well with their friends who have memorized
and practiced the same steps they know. They cannot
dance well with people outside of their own little
preselected group of friends.  To me, this is not a
good thing.

I will always vote for the musicians, who can dance
with anyone.  They can follow the music, and will do
so, even if the step is not perfect. To me, that is
more fun, and you know what?  It works! The music is
what ties the dance partners together, not the perfect
step.  What makes a great dancer is dancing. My
opinion.

PS-  Practice makes perfect, not teaching...

Dear Tine:

Everyone learns something, from everyone, but if you
leave out the forward ocho, I will look elsewhere for
that...lol.

PS-  I dance close embrace 60 to 80 percent of the
time, but I get bored with it, and so do most
Argentine Tango dancers around the world, except the
US Americans, which do it "all the time".  There is
more to life than close embrace.  The forward ocho is
part of that...lol.  Have a great day.

Hi Derik,

Next time you see Andres, ask him to teach you how to
lead a front ocho in close embrace...lol. Then maybe
the rest of us won't have to hear about your little
problem any more...lol.

Sean

P.S. Please don't anyone mention to Derik about all of
the professional dance training that Andres has
had...lol. He seems to be the only self appointed
tango teacher that Derik respects. I'd hate to see
that ruined...lol.

The origins of the word tango/ LATITUDES SPANISH COURSES IN BA

 

  Dear Members this is the last delivery of the origins of the word tango.

  When in BA consult us for

  Spanish Courses at www.latitudesweb.com.ar

 

  or call 155-262-2719

 

  About some tango terms (SOBRE ALGUNOS TIRMINOS TANGUEROS)

 
Por Eduardo Rubin Bernal

 
Academico Titular

 
Academia Nacional del Tango

   Today: Tango III

 

As we have said in a previous note, the word tango is of African origin,
which may have come from the Portuguese, and may have arrived to the African
continent by the middle of the 15th century. The historian, Roberto Selles,
also agrees that Tango is an African word, although he does not profess its
Lusitanian origin, he accepts that tango is an aboriginal term brought to
America by the slaves. Anyhow, both ways of thought are not conflicting
given that from the Portuguese?s early presence in the area to the
beginnings of black slave trade over one century had passed by. The term
Tango well could be considered a ?borrowed? term linguistically speaking in
some or all African tribal languages. 

 

   

Roberto Selles, in his work on the Origen of Tango, (Ediciones Hicuba,
Buenos Aires, 2004), mentions the Cuban, Fernando Ortiz, and his work
Glossary of Afro-negrismos, that some African languages such as those from
the inhabited coast of Calabar, at the extreme of the Niger River, that to
dance is called ?tamgu? and ?tuggu?. Likewise, the Soninki or Sarakolom
inhabitants of Sudan were aware of the word ?ntiangu?. Also, F. Ortiz says
that the Mandingas from West Sudan called ?dango? to dance, and called
tomton or tamtamngo to the drum. Along these lines, Selles and Nestor Ortiz
Oderigo confirm what we said above, adding that in several African idioms
?tamgz? and ?taggu? mean to dance and ?tamtamngo? means drum.  

 

Selles concludes that the word ?tamtamngo? formed by the onomatopoeia ?tam
tam? and the dissonance ?ongo? changed into ?tango? with the inceptions of
?drum? ?a place where to dance?, ?dance?, and ?rhythm?. In the same way, it
arrives in America, South of Spain and Portugal from the spoken forms by
blacks slaves during the 16th and 17th century. This is in reference
naturally to the African dances and rhythms distant from our denomination of
our tango, although we now know it had a lot to do with the origin of
Argentine Tango.

 

Afterwards, towards the beginnings of the 19th century the word was already
present in Andaluc?a, Spain and in Buenos Aires, Argentina, but not yet
connected to the naming of the upcoming native musical specie from Rio de la
Plata.

 

Perhaps it was Carlos Vega, the great Argentine musicologist, the first one
in comprehending and explaining the long path taken by the peculiar word
?Tango?.

 

In signing off of this series of notes we quote sparingly. The word Tango
did not apply in the time mentioned above to the type of porte?o singing,
which had not yet been born. Tango then was simply the Andalucian Tango. It
is not after the 1900?s, when as a result of a diverse upbringing of a wider
spectrum of music under the name of Tango, the composers are required to
utilize a wider palette of musical resources. The musical composers find in
the Milonga the next of kin of the Andalucian Tango, but with a stronger
precedence and of richer form than the latter, and in keeping with under the
familiar and imported name of Tango. However, all that it remains from the
Andalucian Tango is the name, which can now be called Argentine Tango.

 

Chan
Chan. Until next time

OK, here I am again your tango big mouth from Buenos Aires...

Pray tell me Gabriel...if the man does not lead, how am I suppose to 
follow?  Or is it as one confused gentlemen told me in San Francisco a 
few years back...since I did not take the classes (Take your pick - 
Pablo Veron, Fabian Salas, Pulpo, etc.) that is why I did not know the 
steps....If I have to dance with you looking at your feet it is because 
I have to figure out what the hell you are doing...if you aren't a 
beginner...this is what I call a mercy dance...with a guy who cannot lead.

Igor:  A woman too, must understand the music and know how to interpret 
it.  This is what I have been told many times about me - I understand 
the music.  The women's rhythm does not always have to be what the man 
is dancing but it has to move with his. A woman can play with another 
part of the cadencia,  a man who understands the music understands 
her...and waits.  This is the seduction of tango..not 500 fancy steps in 
2 minutes. (I know Igor you did not infer that, it is my own sarcastic 
attitude.)

Sean:  By your logic when I was still commuting to Buenos Aires from San 
Francisco, I should have created many problems in San Francisco.  While 
I probably did create many problems (such is my nature)  I doubt you 
will find that it was because I danced with men who were not at my level 
or set impossible standards for other women...and dragged down my own 
dancing at the same time.  I danced with whoever asked me in my own 
community - because this is where I lived.  This is where I came to 
dance...and I wanted to.

Teaching vs helping on the dance floor...unless the other person 
asks..why don't you just enjoy the music.  If the dance was that 
painful, smile at the end of the tanda and say thank you...and don't 
dance with them again.  No one likes unsolicited advice.

A word to those women who do nothing but complain about the level of the 
men in their community.  Go dance salsa.  (They have usually had a few 
trips to Buenos Aires which of course now makes them an expert.)

I don't lead, I will never lead, I don't want to lead..how can I have 
the passion for the music that I have in the arms of a women?  I cannot, 
it is just that simple.  You ask anyone here who dances and they will 
tell you the passion is for the music and to share it with another 
embraced  while moving together.  Why is it here in Buenos Aires when 
you see women dancing together they are not Argentines?  Saying you have 
to lead and dance with a woman because there are no good men to dance 
with?  Hmmm...no good men, wasn't that the title of a book sometime 
back?  Or was that a good man is hard to find or a .....say good night 
Deby...

Dear Sean:

1.  I chose Andres because I like the way he dances.
2.  Andres would probably tell you and all the other
"close embrace all the time people", to open up the
embrace briefly to allow a front ocho, and then close
the embrace again afterwords.  Variety is the spice of
life, right?

Hi Derik,

Trini, here.  As someone who dances close-embrace most
of the time, I can tell you that it is quite possible
to do a front ocho in close-embrace.  Your posts
indicate that your relative inexperience lets you
believe that such is not possible.  I suggest that if
you worked more on the close-embrace you will discover
a lot more options that you are missing out on.  And
you might understand better why so many people, not
just Americans, enjoy dancing close-embrace
"all-the-time".  

Personally, dancing close allows me to better
communicate with my partner.  This is the spice that
adds a lot of variety to the dance...to those men who
can listen.

Happy tangos, whatever your style.
Trini de Pittsburgh

When Andres Amarilla was 17, he partnered with Geraldine Rojas (then
age 13) for a year.  Together, they performed over 20 times at Buenos
Aires milongas, including Sunderland, Akarence, and Sin Rumbo.

After a lot of searching, we were finally able to locate a video of
one of Andres and Geraldine's performances.  This one was given in
October 1993 at the milonga Glorias Argentinas as an homage to the
legendary Petroleo.  You can see Petroleo at the end of the video,
standing behind the table in the center of the frame.

If you cannot do a forward ocho in close embrace it is because your 
posture is not correct.  You are blocking the woman from moving forward 
with your body.  If she has bad posture as well, then she cannot move 
forward because the combination of bad posture and being blocked will 
not allow it.  There is no other reason to not be able to do a forward 
ocho in close embrace.   AND I dance close embrace almost all of the 
time and I am never bored... Posture/balance/axis ....says it all.

Leading front ochos in close embrace IF the man knows how to move. This is one of the few occasions he is moving backwards. The person moving backwards has to get out of the way of the person coming forward. When leading the woman to step backward, he has to lead the woman to get out of his way. When he moves backward, he has to get himself out of the way so that the woman can come forward. This isn't a posture problem; this is a movement problem.

Men should go to a followers class or follow at a practica. It might open their eyes. It certainly opened mine. I'll never forget the day a woman led me in back ochos. She stepped sideways without waiting for me to finish my pivot to come the other direction. That's the day I understood what my teacher had been telling me for months and clearly didn't understand "WAIT FOR THE WOMAN!!" Following taught me how to move backwards. Men who don't learn how to move backwards are like cars that don't have a reverse gear.

How long are you going to flog that dead horse, Derik? There are 
millions of Argentines including MANY who can't dance a lick. Others who 
dance very well didn't start until later than 6. Still others copy their 
teacher. Jeez. Where I work the boys in black t-shirts would say you 
have a 'chub' for Argentines.

When I was in BsAs last week I saw a lot of dancers at milongas who were 
skilled. More were *not* skilled, or were flaunting their skill in an 
asocial way such as cutting in and out of dance 'lanes' on the floor and 
charging in front of other dancers in order to execute a trick move 
{cough cough El Turco cough cough}. Most of the natives I saw who were 
not skilled were at some early stage of learning. Others lost (or never 
had a) connection to the music and their partner, performing steps 
instead of dancing together. Basically, there are as many kinds of 
Argentines as you can imagine. Or more.  ;)

Dear Trini:

What are you two talking about....lol.  I do front
ochos all the in variations of close and open embrace.
 As you have heard it said many times, "The embrace
opens and closes like a bandondeon."  My point is to
vary the embrace.  You should know how to be connected
with your partner, no matter what.  
Keeping the embrace closed all the time is like
keeping the bandondeon closed all the
time...ridiculous!  My view is that the inexperience
and lack of understanding probably falls more on the
side of the people who do close embrace all the time,
and their teachers who purposely eliminate teaching
the front ocho entirely....like Tine.  Give me a
break....lol.

Dear Derik,

In your post, you seem to blame the close-embrace
style for your boredom rather than, well, yourself. 
If you don't want to do close-embrace all the time,
fine.  But why place a value judgement on those who
do?  

If you do not understand why people choose to do
close-embrace all-the-time, then I can only guess that
1) you don't know enough about close-embrace to keep
it interesting, 2) you do not value the same things
close-embrace people do, or 3) both.  There's nothing
wrong with that, but it is rude for you to place your
values on others on something so personal and
intimate.  "Keeping the embrace closed all the time is
like keeping the bandondeon closed all the
time...ridiculous!" is a value judgement.

If I am misreading you, then let me apologize in
advance.  I do wish, though, that you would express
yourself in a more thoughtful manner.

As a matter of fact, there even are Argentines who have lived in Japan for a
number of years, at some point hit hard times with their business, then took
tango lessons, and later declared themselves to be tango teacher who has
danced tango for 15 years or so. One of them takes credit for having been
born in San Telmo, for having been submerged in tango from before he learned
to walk. The first time I met him in Tokyo, in a tango workshop, he could
not even lead a salida, but he does not remember that now.
Having said that, they are still nice guys, you just can't believe their
inflated resume'.

Humm, just saw this post. Ok, I will jump in.
Derik, I am going to get down to business here (only for a moment). The way
your talking and what I hear, of your interpretation of Tango is.

1. You think and therefore assume too much.
2. Dance the patterns and steps, therefore talk, and therefore all below the
belt.

My question to you Derik. What is tango to you?

(Trini, when we have the opportunity to dance together I request you wear
the shoes that make you growl. I also ask you make this obvious as I am a
man, Thank you.)
 
David~

To the moderators, will only post positive feed back from here on out, I
just needed to ask the question, TKX10

In my experience, the universal constant amongst useless partners is that
they /did/ take beginner classes. Most notably the girls crippled by steps
that the've had drilled into them before getting a chance to learn to
follow, or even to experience the feel of a real lead. Yes they 'think they
know what they are doing' - inevitably, given that's what the lesson is
telling them every time they succeed in copying the demonstrated material.

A girl that never took beginner classes exhibits none of these dysfuctions.
She does not interpret two steps on the side to mean she must cross. A
pause does not send her into a loop of auto-ochos. She does not take every
simple squeeze of a foot to be a sandwich that triggers a step-over.

How could she? In learning on the dancefloor, she never encounters these
class fabrications. Even when unfortunate enough to get a leader programmed
full of them. Because just like his teacher he rarely if ever leads them,
and instead (just like his teacher) resorts to verbal instruction. She
learns... but not to do the fake steps. She learns to say "No".

I recall the advice of a great dancer who was also a needs-must teacher:
"Don't take classes. Not even my classes. Classes are for those who cannot
dance."

The problem I have with the "close embrace all the
time" people is ignorance, and then them trying to
spread that ignorance around, by promoting their own
inexperienced teachers.  If the "close embrace all the
time people" would just dance the way they want to and
leave other people alone (not try to teach their
ignorance), then I would have no problem with them at
all.

I agree with you that personal taste is OK.  Everyone
has their own tango.  I have said this many times.  We
dancers should choose our tango teachers ourselves. We
should not have a tango teachers recruit and choose us
as their victims, and tell us that we are
inexperienced fools.

Derek:
I'd love to give you a break! Your arrogance is only exceeded by your ignorance of close embrace. Changing the embrace? Why would I want to do that? The embrace is like two batteries in a flashlight. If they aren't in contact (facing the correct direction), the light doesn't come on. To dance open would break the circuit between the batteries. I don't want to break the circuit with my partner. 

I've never heard "The embrace opens and closes like a bandondeon." WRONG!! My heart opens and closes like a bandeneon, not the embrace. Sometimes I can also feel her heart pounding. I may have to slightly adjust the embrace to allow the woman more room for a figure, but there's NO good reason to go from close to open. If couples have to go to open for a figure, it's probably a show tango figure, not appropriate to the social floor. Or one, if not both, partners are so stiff they can't dance close because their stiff arms prevents them from getting close.

Thank goodness it's a beautiful spring day in Washington and I'm going out to enjoy it instead of reading Derek's posts.

I think Derek must be someone playing 'Devil's Advocate' and just having a laugh. If not, I think it would be quite funny to watch him dance. I wonder who taught him - or tried to teach him...

Derik,
In support of Michael Ditkoff and others, please stop posting until 
you learn at least something about Argentine Tango.
Try to learn just a little bit.

Derik says:

"The problem I have with the "close embrace all the
time" people is ignorance, and then them trying to
spread that ignorance around, by promoting their own
inexperienced teachers.  If the "close embrace all the
time people" would just dance the way they want to and
leave other people alone (not try to teach their
ignorance), then I would have no problem with them at
all."

I think we should analyze the reasons a particular individual chooses to 
dance in a particular way.

1 - The style of the local available instructor.   Here we should 
acknowledge the existence of several periods:

An initial period  (early nineties):

Most instructors traveling abroad  taught open embrace salon style (called 
tango fantasia by some people, nowadays).

This style could be very demanding in the way of physical conditioning, 
dancing skills and availability of space to dance, (it trains for stage 
dancing although it can be done as a social form) but it can be simplified 
to some extent to adjust to different circumstances.

The students at this period (ignorant of the existence of different tango 
styles assumed that that was the only Argentine Tango).

A few years later ( mid nineties):

People started to travel to Argentina to improve their dancing and 
discovered that most people at the milongas danced in close embrace. A 
different form of the one they had been taught.

This form was more compact, kept the close embrace all the time except for 
minor adjustments and the best of all: it was excellent for dancing in 
crowded milongas and at the same time it was not as demanding of physical 
conditioning, skills and rigorous training as the other form. It was ideal 
for social dancing done by people of all ages and physical aptitude.

These people returned home believing that they had been cheated and 
proclaimed that the "real tango was done in close embrace".  At the same 
time instructors of this style started to travel abroad saying " if you wish 
to dance in buenos Aires, you should learn this style, because most people 
there dance this form. They were not lying, this was the truth.

They said "most" people dance only in close embrace. They neglected to 
mention that many others danced 'Salon open embrace' , that many danced both 
ways open and close embrace, and that a few were starting to dance "Nuevo 
tango" and "Canyengue".

During this period many people started instruction in 'milonguero, close 
embrace'.
That was all they knew, they were convinced this was the only tango that 
existed. Many other dancers frustrated with their impossibility to master 
the 'Tango Fantasia' joined in. They had plenty of room to dance but they 
chose to make the room smaller to reproduce the situation in Buenos Aires.

When dancing with beginners of "open embrace" started to complain about 
them: "they show off",
"they dance externally (for the audience) rather than internally the way we 
do it", "they are rude, as they provoke frequent collisions", etc.   The 
dancers of only 'Open embrace rarely complained about the others but 
interiorly many of them thought that close embrace seemed to be an 
"inferior" form of dancing tango.

During this period Nuevo Tango was introduced by traveling instructors of 
this style.

  Here again we have a style that is very demanding in the way of physical 
aptitude, skills and training.
Due to all those factors this style atracted mostly young dancers.

Will continue, Best regards, Sergio.

Dear Michael:

Why does it not surprise me that you have never heard
of the expression.

"I've never heard "The embrace opens and closes like
 a bandondeon.""

This is the kind of ignorance that I am talking about.
 Furthermore, I do dance close embrace 60 to 80
percent of the time, so please do not tell me that I
have never experienced "close embrace all the time". 
I have!

Like you, I feel her heart pounding, but I also know
when she wants some space to express herself.  Of
course to do this, she would have to know how to
dance...lol.  This is the big problem with "close
embrace all the time" followers, who have not really
learned the entire dance.  They are stuck with no
ideas for open, so they have to avoid it.

Doing one thing all the time is way too much.  Variety
is the spice of life.

PS-  I can always tell when the "close embrace all the
time people" arrive in a room to dance.  The music the
DJ plays suddenly becomes very predictable and cutsie
stuff... rather dull.  When "the parents" go home,
then the music then changes again and becomes more
lively.

I guess I just get tired of all the predictability,
the cutsie same old repetitious choreography. and the
"gee, look how cute we are" mentality....and the
constant recruitment of inexperienced teachers and
students to teach this boring stuff.

I like to see more real energy on the dance floor. 
where people really know how to navigate the floor in
complex patterns, follow the changes in the music, and
"move" instead of just going through the motions.  My
opinion.

Other than that, have a beautiful day in Washington. 
Weather here is beautiful too, and I am going to enjoy
it as well.  Happy Spring.

Now we have people that only know how to dance in one or the other style 
(open or close embrace).  Discussions started in reference to every aspect 
of the dance as the different styles have certain elements that 
differentiate them. (technique, goal, etc).

I started then the discussion of different styles in A. Tango. I was 
attacked from every corner as every one had reasons to believe that I 
favored one style over the others. Many tango instructors felt threatened 
feeling that my talking about certain possible choices at the time of taking 
lessons was going to cause them to lose students.

Now we have a period when we understand that there are several forms or 
styles in which one can dance tango.  The discussion however persists.

Somebody just said that Derik is playing Devil's advocate stimulating a 
discussion while as he would say "lol".

I do not think this to be the case I think that he genuinely thinks that he 
was cheated by the instructors of 'close embrace tango' the same as the 
earlier dancers believed that the instructors of 'open style' had cheated 
them.

But you know what ?, nobody was cheated . There are many styles to dance and 
every instructor teaches the one he knows.

Among the reasons for preferring a style over another we could consider (now 
that we know we have a choice):

a) Age and physical skills:   Everyone should dance according to his age.  
An older person should not pretend  to dance like a young one would do. 
There are people that dance very fast, doing all sort of skillful moves in a 
few seconds and there are others that dance very slowly.

b) Your goal as a dancer:  Do you want to be a social dancer or you have the 
goal of becoming a professional, stage tango dancer. Do you want to become a 
tango teacher?  While it is possible to do any style socially it is obvious 
that close embrace (including canyengue) adapts the best to crowded 
milongas. The other styles open embrace salon and nuevo require lots of room 
to dance more or less comfortably.

We certainly do not have to dance close embrace because it is done in the 
crowded milongas of B.A. when we have lots of room available. We let other 
factors determine our preference.

c) It is possible that you tried Open Embrace or Nuevo but finally you 
decided that your final preference is Close Embrace.

Many people I know belong to this group. They started dancing Open style, 
some are able to do it with excellency but prefer to do close embrace. There 
are many others that found open embrace frustrating and very demanding and 
ended up finding that close embrace corresponds more with their age, 
physical aptitude and spiritual needs.

Summary: Whatever your preference as to style is, tango offers you a wealth 
and a life full of enjoyment and discovery.

As to Derik, I do not know dear Derik,  if you failed to notice, but most 
people recently accepted the fact as stated in my summary, they ceased to 
argue about which style is superior, you are the only one left.

You may have a valid point: it is best to know many styles so that you can 
adapt to every situation.

That is *your* preference, and I think that it is fine but... you should 
accept the fact that most people  are perfectly satisfied and happy dancing 
only one style. A style that perfectly fulfils all their needs.

Best regards, Sergio

Derik, you've made me curious.  Could you please give us some examples
of the boring close-embrace music you do not like vs. the lively music
you prefer?  Give us titles and orchestras, or mp3 samples if you
prefer.

Why does it not surprise me that you have never heard

"I've never heard "The embrace opens and closes like

This is the kind of ignorance that I am talking about.
Furthermore, I do dance close embrace 60 to 80
percent of the time, so please do not tell me that I
have never experienced "close embrace all the time". 
I have!

Like you, I feel her heart pounding, but I also know
when she wants some space to express herself. Of
course to do this, she would have to know how to
dance...lol. This is the big problem with "close
embrace all the time" followers, who have not really
learned the entire dance. They are stuck with no
ideas for open, so they have to avoid it.

Doing one thing all the time is way too much. Variety
is the spice of life.

PS- I can always tell when the "close embrace all the
time people" arrive in a room to dance. The music the
DJ plays suddenly becomes very predictable and cutsie
stuff... rather dull. When "the parents" go home,
then the music then changes again and becomes more
lively.

I guess I just get tired of all the predictability,
the cutsie same old repetitious choreography. and the
"gee, look how cute we are" mentality....and the
constant recruitment of inexperienced teachers and
students to teach this boring stuff.

I like to see more real energy on the dance floor. 
where people really know how to navigate the floor in
complex patterns, follow the changes in the music, and
"move" instead of just going through the motions. My
opinion.

Other than that, have a beautiful day in Washington. 
Weather here is beautiful too, and I am going to enjoy
it as well. Happy Spring.

I am truly amazed that 1200 peple on this list let this idiot Derik call them ignorant, incompetent, dull, predictable, inexperienced, same old, boring, BS. This is just the words from this email. You let him do this not just once, but over and over again. For years! Incredible. Mind-boggling!
   
  That's another idiot from Texas that you let walk all over you. At least the other one, you elected him, and you know he's not going to be there forever.
   
  Don't any of you have any b*lls on you? (well a few of you do) What's the matter with you?

If people don't respond to outrageous inflammatory e-mail, maybe it's
because the responses just fuel more of the same. The best thing to do
is to ignore this kind of posting. We don't really want to reinforce
it. If no one responds to it, he will just be talking to himself. He
might start talking louder initially to get attention, but maybe
eventually he'll just go away.

At this point one may ask where can I dance open embrace or Nuevo Tango.

As you know many of us either in Argentina or abroad were taught 'Open 
embrace' tango to discover that when we went to the milongas we could not 
dance.

We were taught lots of non progressive figures and when we went dancing we 
discovered that the dance was progressive, it was necessary to continuously 
walk around the room, counter clock wise without disturbing anyone around us 
and do a figure when space and circumstance allowed it.

At this point in the travel of tango discovery we started to learn and 
practice 'close embrace'. Once we mastered this technique and form of 
dancing we were finally able to dance in the milongas of B.A. :))

Some of us also continued exploring and discovering the possibilities of 
'Open Style' tango.

Some of us discovered Nuevo Tango and felt it was exciting to learn a new 
way of doing things.
We particularly liked the sorpresive element of many of its moves.

But it was obvious that if we arrived at a crowded milonga we could only 
dance close embrace.

So we had to arrive early or stay late to be able to dance open, when more 
space was available.

The mood (as Derik describes) changes after most people leave by 4 am and 
there is more space to dance. The music changes, it could be more Pugliese, 
more Piazzola, More Raul Garello, more alternative music, synthetized music, 
etc.  The dancers open the embrace and they start flying around the room in 
a magical way, like in a ballet throwing  ganchos, amagues, heel sacadas, 
linear boleos, etc, without bothering each other. As I said it can look like 
a choreographed ballet.

This last group will continue to take lessons in open and/or nuevo, go to 
practicas and organize their own milongas.

Many milongas could occur at Sunderland in Villa Urquiza when there is room 
to dance, or "La Marshall" (gay milonga) on wednesdays. Or certain areas of 
certain milongas such as 'La viruta" upstairs.

Outside B.A. most people dance Salon open or close embrace, again depending 
on the space available.  I dance a lot in Mar del Plata where most people 
like to dance salon open or close.

At "La Rada" they dance Nuevo Tango. Mar del Plata has a large group of 
Nuevo Tango dancers.

But where you can dance open embrace or nuevo tango is in the USA. There is 
plenty of space here
to dance in any way you wish. Milongas are not as crowded as in B.A. (of 
course there are exceptions ).  So if you prefer open embrace or Nuevo Tango 
by all means continue to dance that way. after all you dance 50 weeks a year 
in the USA and only two weeks in B.A.
I find absurd that people would dance close embrace because that is the way 
people in B.A. are forced to do.   Dance close embrace only if this is your 
preference.

Summary:  Most people dance salon close embrace. You have to look for the 
place and the oportunity to do the other styles. Dance anyway you like.

The learning sequencial process for many of us was: Salon open embrace, 
salon close embrace, milonguero close embrace, Nuevo tango, Canyengue.

For others has been:  Salon close embrace (they remained there).

                              Salon milonguero (they remained there).

                              Salon open, close, Nuevo. (they remained 
there).

                             Salon close, Canyengue. They are still learning 
this last form.

Some are starting to amalgamate taking elements from different styles.

We all continue to learn.

I hope that this helps to clarify this matter. Remember that this is my 
opinion according to my own experience but other people may have different 
ideas and they are welcome.

Best regards, Sergio.

Dear Tine:

So now you too have appointed yourself the
spokesperson and Representative for all 1200 people on
this list.  Your buddy, Michael Figart did that
already, twice..lol.

When are you "close embrace all the time" people going
to leave everybody alone and just let them dance the
way they want to without trying to teach them your
stuff and turn them into tango robots.  I am so tired
of all this "parental control" and ignorance.  You
guys need to learn instead of teach.  My opinion.

Dear Sergio:

I agree with everything you have said below, and I
think you have also perhaps answered Zoltan's question
below as well, about the change in music later in the
evening.  Thank you for your insight and perspective.

Derik, you've made me curious.  Could you please give
us some examples of the boring close-embrace music you
do not like vs. the lively music you prefer?  Give us
titles and orchestras, or mp3 samples if you
prefer.

Derik:
I surmise that YOUR teacher(s) did you a disservice. You mistakenly think an embrace has to be broken for a woman to express herself. Not only do you show a poor understanding of leading, you also show NO understanding of following!!

Name some figures that can't be done in close embrace. Give me some facts instead of your opinions masquerading as facts. Just because YOU don't know how to lead figures in close embrace doesn't mean they can't be done in close embrace. You're NOT the gold standard of close embrace.

The women I dance with are quite capable of expressing themselves in close embrace.

If a woman wants space, it might not be because she wants to express herself. Maybe she just wants to GET AWAY FROM YOU!!

Since you are mathematically challenged, 60 to 80 percent is not all the time.

  Dear Michael:

  Why does it not surprise me that you have never heard
  of the expression.

  "I've never heard "The embrace opens and closes like
   a bandondeon.""

  This is the kind of ignorance that I am talking about.
   Furthermore, I do dance close embrace 60 to 80
  percent of the time, so please do not tell me that I
  have never experienced "close embrace all the time". 
  I have!

  Like you, I feel her heart pounding, but I also know
  when she wants some space to express herself.  Of
  course to do this, she would have to know how to
  dance...lol.  This is the big problem with "close
  embrace all the time" followers, who have not really
  learned the entire dance.  They are stuck with no
  ideas for open, so they have to avoid it.

  Doing one thing all the time is way too much.  Variety
  is the spice of life.

I have yet to find a video or DVD that could be really useful to 
beginning dancers; a good 2-hour video could address walking, 
lead/follow, the embrace (with variations),  a salida, cadencias, 
forward and back ochos.  None of the ones I've seen (and I've seen most 
of those  easily available)  try to emphasize technique which is what 
beginning tango is all about, or rather what all tango is about. Maybe 
there is a good beginners tape or DVD for close embrace but not that 
I've seen.

Please note, we haven't seen Christy Cote's DVDs; hope to remedy that soon.

Also, although there are several good Followers' tapes, especially that 
by Rebecca Shulman, the only one I know of for Leaders is superficial 
and does not discuss leading, for Pete's sake.

Have I missed something?
