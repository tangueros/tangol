<pre>Derik:
I surmise that YOUR teacher(s) did you a disservice. You mistakenly think an embrace has to be broken for a woman to express herself. Not only do you show a poor understanding of leading, you also show NO understanding of following!!

Name some figures that can't be done in close embrace. Give me some facts instead of your opinions masquerading as facts. Just because YOU don't know how to lead figures in close embrace doesn't mean they can't be done in close embrace. You're NOT the gold standard of close embrace.

The women I dance with are quite capable of expressing themselves in close embrace.

If a woman wants space, it might not be because she wants to express herself. Maybe she just wants to GET AWAY FROM YOU!!

Since you are mathematically challenged, 60 to 80 percent is not all the time.

Wish there was a pill for Derik. Sudafed won't work.

  Dear Michael:

  Why does it not surprise me that you have never heard
  of the expression.

  &quot;I've never heard &quot;The embrace opens and closes like
   a bandondeon.&quot;&quot;

  This is the kind of ignorance that I am talking about.
   Furthermore, I do dance close embrace 60 to 80
  percent of the time, so please do not tell me that I
  have never experienced &quot;close embrace all the time&quot;. 
  I have!

  Like you, I feel her heart pounding, but I also know
  when she wants some space to express herself.  Of
  course to do this, she would have to know how to
  dance...lol.  This is the big problem with &quot;close
  embrace all the time&quot; followers, who have not really
  learned the entire dance.  They are stuck with no
  ideas for open, so they have to avoid it.

  Doing one thing all the time is way too much.  Variety
  is the spice of life.

  &gt; I'd love to give you a break! Your arrogance is only
  &gt; exceeded by your ignorance of close embrace.
  &gt; Changing the embrace? Why would I want to do that?
  &gt; The embrace is like two batteries in a flashlight.
  &gt; If they aren't in contact (facing the correct
  &gt; direction), the light doesn't come on. To dance open
  &gt; would break the circuit between the batteries. I
  &gt; don't want to break the circuit with my partner. 
  &gt; 
  &gt; I've never heard &quot;The embrace opens and closes like
  &gt; a bandondeon.&quot; WRONG!! My heart opens and closes
  &gt; like a bandeneon, not the embrace. Sometimes I can
  &gt; also feel her heart pounding. I may have to slightly
  &gt; adjust the embrace to allow the woman more room for
  &gt; a figure, but there's NO good reason to go from
  &gt; close to open. If couples have to go to open for a
  &gt; figure, it's probably a show tango figure, not
  &gt; appropriate to the social floor. Or one, if not
  &gt; both, partners are so stiff they can't dance close
  &gt; because their stiff arms prevents them from getting
  &gt; close.
