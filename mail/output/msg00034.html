<pre>I strongly disagree, Igor. Your posturing only encourages women to walk away 
from their share of the responsability for the dance and promotes the 
&quot;if-you-can-lead-I can-follow&quot; nonsense attitude.

&gt; Contrary to Tine,
&gt; I think most women are good dancers.
&gt; And many many women are excellent.
&gt; An 99% of all beginners are able to make a fairly good dance with a good
&gt; leader (if not - he is not a good one yet).
&gt;
&gt; I can say only opposite about men.
&gt;
&gt; I think it is much easier for a woman to become a good tango dancer than 
&gt; for
&gt; a man, and never the less men are those who want to learn less. And Tine's
&gt; example shows just that!
&gt;
&gt; I understand what Tine said. What she said means that those women are not
&gt; good enough to be perfect instruments in men's learning. It is difficult 
&gt; to
&gt; learn with not finely tuned instrument. They are good enough for dancing
&gt; with a good leader, but not good for a clumsy beginner. Because, that
&gt; beginner man must know how to follow! Of course, he does not.
&gt;
&gt; I really appreciate advanced women for sharing their time with less 
&gt; advanced
&gt; dancers. That is how our community grows and that is how I grew myself. I
&gt; can not express in words how I am grateful! That is an attraction and most
&gt; important help for tango men.
&gt;
&gt; Fewer women in the milonga classes? That is what supposed to be! I vote 
&gt; for
&gt; women/men = 1/10. :)
&gt; I believe that is the major reason why tango became tango. Why men should
&gt; torture women with their learning? They should practice with themselves or
&gt; hire a good teacher to bring them to shape.
&gt;
&gt; But it is a dream, I do not think it will ever happen again like it was in
&gt; Buenos Aires.
&gt;
&gt; How to attract men to classes? It looks like it is a real problem. I do 
&gt; not
&gt; know. Often girls bring them. May be with time, when Tango gains more 
&gt; social
&gt; status, and become less complex ( could  it? ).
&gt; Tango definitely has a potential of winning greater social status - you 
&gt; can
&gt; not dance any other dance in any place with any music, but you can tango!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Igor Polk.
&gt; PS She can not make a volcada? Jeeeeeeeeeee.....
&gt; But what a hell a man you are if you can not lead anything else!
