<pre>What he said.

It is possible for a follower to be essentially useless as a dance
partner.  I've met more than a few.  The worst is when they
think they know what they are doing.  The universal constant
with them is that they hardly ever take instruction, a few classes
a year, and at that, they never took beginner classes.

To summarize, I like how Tom Stermitz defines intermediate:
not taking classes anymore.

The real magic of tango happens with both partners operating
at a high level.  And for followers to operate at that level they
need to work as hard as the leads.

&gt;Hola Igor,
&gt;
&gt;Sean here. It wasn't so long ago that I thought just
&gt;like you do. But I have recently seen (but not yet
&gt;implemented) the wisdom of Tine's observations.
&gt;
&gt;For years I have been one of those guys who always
&gt;tries to make my partners feel like they can do
&gt;nothing wrong. Many, many teachers have taught me to
&gt;do just that. Then last year, a top instructor taught
&gt;workshops in Pittsburgh for the first time. He had a
&gt;very different point of view. He held me personally
&gt;responsible for the burgeoning mediocrity of many
&gt;Pittsburgh followers because I make them feel like
&gt;they can really dance. He was very insistent that I
&gt;stop dancing with intermediate dancers, to encourage
&gt;them to improve. He also pointed out that when I make
&gt;a mediocre dancer look very good, it is very
&gt;discouraging to other advanced leaders who are not so
&gt;skilled at compensating for the women's mistakes.
&gt;Finally, I also discovered that in order to be always
&gt;ready to adjust for the woman's misstep, I hold back
&gt;my own intention.
&gt;
&gt;It is clear to me that this guy is right on all three
&gt;points. By dancing with intermediate followers, I rob
&gt;them of the incentive to improve, I set an impossible
&gt;standard for the other men, and I hold back my own
&gt;development. But for the most part, I have not been
&gt;successful implementing a change. When I have told
&gt;women that I don't want to dance with them because
&gt;they have not improved in a while, their reaction has
&gt;varied in its unpleasantness, but it has never been to
&gt;start taking classes again. I hope Tine will also hug
&gt;the woman who started going to classes again. I wish
&gt;there were more honest women like her.
&gt;
&gt;Sean
&gt;
&gt;P.S.  I particularly like Tine's point about dancing
&gt;verses just following. I am sure any man knows exactly
&gt;what she means, but how do you explain it to the women
&gt;who don't lead? Does anyone have any tips for teaching
&gt;women to dance, instead of just following?
