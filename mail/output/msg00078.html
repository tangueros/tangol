<pre>Dear Sergio:

I agree with everything you have said below, and I
think you have also perhaps answered Zoltan's question
below as well, about the change in music later in the
evening.  Thank you for your insight and perspective.

The music changes, it could be more Pugliese, 
more Piazzola, More Raul Garello, more alternative
music, synthetized music, etc.&quot;

PS-  I can always tell when the &quot;close embrace all the
time people&quot; arrive in a room to dance.  The music the
DJ plays suddenly becomes very predictable and cutsie
stuff... rather dull.  When &quot;the parents&quot; go home,
then the music then changes again and becomes more
lively.

Derik, you've made me curious.  Could you please give
us some examples of the boring close-embrace music you
do not like vs. the lively music you prefer?  Give us
titles and orchestras, or mp3 samples if you
prefer.

&gt; At this point one may ask where can I dance open
&gt; embrace or Nuevo Tango.
&gt; 
&gt; As you know many of us either in Argentina or abroad
&gt; were taught 'Open 
&gt; embrace' tango to discover that when we went to the
&gt; milongas we could not 
&gt; dance.
&gt; 
&gt; We were taught lots of non progressive figures and
&gt; when we went dancing we 
&gt; discovered that the dance was progressive, it was
&gt; necessary to continuously 
&gt; walk around the room, counter clock wise without
&gt; disturbing anyone around us 
&gt; and do a figure when space and circumstance allowed
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; At this point in the travel of tango discovery we
&gt; started to learn and 
&gt; practice 'close embrace'. Once we mastered this
&gt; technique and form of 
&gt; dancing we were finally able to dance in the
&gt; milongas of B.A. :))
&gt; 
&gt; Some of us also continued exploring and discovering
&gt; the possibilities of 
&gt; 'Open Style' tango.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of us discovered Nuevo Tango and felt it was
&gt; exciting to learn a new 
&gt; way of doing things.
&gt; We particularly liked the sorpresive element of many
&gt; of its moves.
&gt; 
&gt; But it was obvious that if we arrived at a crowded
&gt; milonga we could only 
&gt; dance close embrace.
&gt; 
&gt; So we had to arrive early or stay late to be able to
&gt; dance open, when more 
&gt; space was available.
&gt; 
&gt; The mood (as Derik describes) changes after most
&gt; people leave by 4 am and 
&gt; there is more space to dance. The music changes, it
&gt; could be more Pugliese, 
&gt; more Piazzola, More Raul Garello, more alternative
&gt; music, synthetized music, 
&gt; etc.  The dancers open the embrace and they start
&gt; flying around the room in 
&gt; a magical way, like in a ballet throwing  ganchos,
&gt; amagues, heel sacadas, 
&gt; linear boleos, etc, without bothering each other. As
&gt; I said it can look like 
&gt; a choreographed ballet.
&gt; 
&gt; This last group will continue to take lessons in
&gt; open and/or nuevo, go to 
&gt; practicas and organize their own milongas.
&gt; 
&gt; Many milongas could occur at Sunderland in Villa
&gt; Urquiza when there is room 
&gt; to dance, or &quot;La Marshall&quot; (gay milonga) on
&gt; wednesdays. Or certain areas of 
&gt; certain milongas such as 'La viruta&quot; upstairs.
&gt; 
&gt; Outside B.A. most people dance Salon open or close
&gt; embrace, again depending 
&gt; on the space available.  I dance a lot in Mar del
&gt; Plata where most people 
&gt; like to dance salon open or close.
&gt; 
&gt; At &quot;La Rada&quot; they dance Nuevo Tango. Mar del Plata
&gt; has a large group of 
&gt; Nuevo Tango dancers.
&gt; 
&gt; But where you can dance open embrace or nuevo tango
&gt; is in the USA. There is 
&gt; plenty of space here
&gt; to dance in any way you wish. Milongas are not as
&gt; crowded as in B.A. (of 
&gt; course there are exceptions ).  So if you prefer
&gt; open embrace or Nuevo Tango 
&gt; by all means continue to dance that way. after all
&gt; you dance 50 weeks a year 
&gt; in the USA and only two weeks in B.A.
&gt; I find absurd that people would dance close embrace
&gt; because that is the way 
&gt; people in B.A. are forced to do.   Dance close
&gt; embrace only if this is your 
&gt; preference.
&gt; 
&gt; Summary:  Most people dance salon close embrace. You
&gt; have to look for the 
&gt; place and the oportunity to do the other styles.
&gt; Dance anyway you like.
&gt; 
&gt; The learning sequencial process for many of us was:
&gt; Salon open embrace, 
&gt; salon close embrace, milonguero close embrace, Nuevo
&gt; tango, Canyengue.
&gt; 
&gt; For others has been:  Salon close embrace (they
&gt; remained there).
&gt; 
&gt;                               Salon milonguero (they
&gt; remained there).
&gt; 
&gt;                               Salon open, close,
&gt; Nuevo. (they remained 
&gt; there).
&gt; 
&gt;                              Salon close, Canyengue.
&gt; They are still learning 
&gt; this last form.
&gt; 
&gt; Some are starting to amalgamate taking elements from
&gt; different styles.
&gt; 
&gt; We all continue to learn.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope that this helps to clarify this matter.
&gt; Remember that this is my 
&gt; opinion according to my own experience but other
&gt; people may have different 
&gt; ideas and they are welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards, Sergio.
