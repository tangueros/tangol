  Dear Michael:

Why does it not surprise me that you have never heard
of the expression.

&quot;I've never heard &quot;The embrace opens and closes like
a bandondeon.&quot;&quot;

This is the kind of ignorance that I am talking about.
Furthermore, I do dance close embrace 60 to 80
percent of the time, so please do not tell me that I
have never experienced &quot;close embrace all the time&quot;. 
I have!

Like you, I feel her heart pounding, but I also know
when she wants some space to express herself. Of
course to do this, she would have to know how to
dance...lol. This is the big problem with &quot;close
embrace all the time&quot; followers, who have not really
learned the entire dance. They are stuck with no
ideas for open, so they have to avoid it.

Doing one thing all the time is way too much. Variety
is the spice of life.

PS- I can always tell when the &quot;close embrace all the
time people&quot; arrive in a room to dance. The music the
DJ plays suddenly becomes very predictable and cutsie
stuff... rather dull. When &quot;the parents&quot; go home,
then the music then changes again and becomes more
lively.

I guess I just get tired of all the predictability,
the cutsie same old repetitious choreography. and the
&quot;gee, look how cute we are&quot; mentality....and the
constant recruitment of inexperienced teachers and
students to teach this boring stuff.

I like to see more real energy on the dance floor. 
where people really know how to navigate the floor in
complex patterns, follow the changes in the music, and
&quot;move&quot; instead of just going through the motions. My
opinion.

Other than that, have a beautiful day in Washington. 
Weather here is beautiful too, and I am going to enjoy
it as well. Happy Spring.

&gt; I'd love to give you a break! Your arrogance is only
&gt; exceeded by your ignorance of close embrace.
&gt; Changing the embrace? Why would I want to do that?
&gt; The embrace is like two batteries in a flashlight.
&gt; If they aren't in contact (facing the correct
&gt; direction), the light doesn't come on. To dance open
&gt; would break the circuit between the batteries. I
&gt; don't want to break the circuit with my partner. 
&gt; 
&gt; I've never heard &quot;The embrace opens and closes like
&gt; a bandondeon.&quot; WRONG!! My heart opens and closes
&gt; like a bandeneon, not the embrace. Sometimes I can
&gt; also feel her heart pounding. I may have to slightly
&gt; adjust the embrace to allow the woman more room for
&gt; a figure, but there's NO good reason to go from
&gt; close to open. If couples have to go to open for a
&gt; figure, it's probably a show tango figure, not
&gt; appropriate to the social floor. Or one, if not
&gt; both, partners are so stiff they can't dance close
&gt; because their stiff arms prevents them from getting
&gt; close.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank goodness it's a beautiful spring day in
&gt; Washington and I'm going out to enjoy it instead of
&gt; reading Derek's posts.

&gt; I'd rather be dancing Argentine Tango
&gt; 
&gt; Looking forward to my next trip to NY to dance with
&gt; N. and O. I thought I knew close embrace. These
&gt; women dance closer embrace.

&gt; I do front ochos all the in variations of close
&gt; and open embrace. As you have heard it said many
&gt; times, &quot;The embrace
&gt; opens and closes like a bandondeon.&quot; My point is
&gt; to vary the embrace. You should know how to be
&gt; connected
&gt; with your partner, no matter what. Keeping the
&gt; embrace closed all the time is like
&gt; keeping the bandondeon closed all the
&gt; time...ridiculous! My view is that the inexperience
&gt; and lack of understanding probably falls more on
&gt; the side of the people who do close embrace all the
&gt; time,
&gt; and their teachers who purposely eliminate
&gt; teaching the front ocho entirely....like Tine. Give
&gt; me a
&gt; break....lol.
