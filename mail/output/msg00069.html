&gt; 
&gt; &quot;The problem I have with the &quot;close embrace all the
&gt; time&quot; people is ignorance, and then them trying to
&gt; spread that ignorance around, by promoting their own
&gt; inexperienced teachers.  If the &quot;close embrace all
&gt; the
&gt; time people&quot; would just dance the way they want to
&gt; and
&gt; leave other people alone (not try to teach their
&gt; ignorance), then I would have no problem with them
&gt; at
&gt; all.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I think we should analyze the reasons a particular
&gt; individual chooses to 
&gt; dance in a particular way.
&gt; 
&gt; 1 - The style of the local available instructor.  
&gt; Here we should 
&gt; acknowledge the existence of several periods:
&gt; 
&gt; An initial period  (early nineties):
&gt; 
&gt; Most instructors traveling abroad  taught open
&gt; embrace salon style (called 
&gt; tango fantasia by some people, nowadays).
&gt; 
&gt; This style could be very demanding in the way of
&gt; physical conditioning, 
&gt; dancing skills and availability of space to dance,
&gt; (it trains for stage 
&gt; dancing although it can be done as a social form)
&gt; but it can be simplified 
&gt; to some extent to adjust to different circumstances.
&gt; 
&gt; The students at this period (ignorant of the
&gt; existence of different tango 
&gt; styles assumed that that was the only Argentine
&gt; Tango).
&gt; 
&gt; A few years later ( mid nineties):
&gt; 
&gt; People started to travel to Argentina to improve
&gt; their dancing and 
&gt; discovered that most people at the milongas danced
&gt; in close embrace. A 
&gt; different form of the one they had been taught.
&gt; 
&gt; This form was more compact, kept the close embrace
&gt; all the time except for 
&gt; minor adjustments and the best of all: it was
&gt; excellent for dancing in 
&gt; crowded milongas and at the same time it was not as
&gt; demanding of physical 
&gt; conditioning, skills and rigorous training as the
&gt; other form. It was ideal 
&gt; for social dancing done by people of all ages and
&gt; physical aptitude.
&gt; 
&gt; These people returned home believing that they had
&gt; been cheated and 
&gt; proclaimed that the &quot;real tango was done in close
&gt; embrace&quot;.  At the same 
&gt; time instructors of this style started to travel
&gt; abroad saying &quot; if you wish 
&gt; to dance in buenos Aires, you should learn this
&gt; style, because most people 
&gt; there dance this form. They were not lying, this was
&gt; the truth.
&gt; 
&gt; They said &quot;most&quot; people dance only in close embrace.
&gt; They neglected to 
&gt; mention that many others danced 'Salon open embrace'
&gt; , that many danced both 
&gt; ways open and close embrace, and that a few were
&gt; starting to dance &quot;Nuevo 
&gt; tango&quot; and &quot;Canyengue&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; During this period many people started instruction
&gt; in 'milonguero, close 
&gt; embrace'.
&gt; That was all they knew, they were convinced this was
&gt; the only tango that 
&gt; existed. Many other dancers frustrated with their
&gt; impossibility to master 
&gt; the 'Tango Fantasia' joined in. They had plenty of
&gt; room to dance but they 
&gt; chose to make the room smaller to reproduce the
&gt; situation in Buenos Aires.
&gt; 
&gt; When dancing with beginners of &quot;open embrace&quot;
&gt; started to complain about 
&gt; them: &quot;they show off&quot;,
&gt; &quot;they dance externally (for the audience) rather
&gt; than internally the way we 
&gt; do it&quot;, &quot;they are rude, as they provoke frequent
&gt; collisions&quot;, etc.   The 
&gt; dancers of only 'Open embrace rarely complained
&gt; about the others but 
&gt; interiorly many of them thought that close embrace
&gt; seemed to be an 
&gt; &quot;inferior&quot; form of dancing tango.
&gt; 
&gt; During this period Nuevo Tango was introduced by
&gt; traveling instructors of 
&gt; this style.
&gt; 
&gt;   Here again we have a style that is very demanding
&gt; in the way of physical 
&gt; aptitude, skills and training.
&gt; Due to all those factors this style atracted mostly
&gt; young dancers.
&gt; 
&gt; Will continue, Best regards, Sergio.
