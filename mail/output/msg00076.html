<pre>At this point one may ask where can I dance open embrace or Nuevo Tango.

As you know many of us either in Argentina or abroad were taught 'Open 
embrace' tango to discover that when we went to the milongas we could not 
dance.

We were taught lots of non progressive figures and when we went dancing we 
discovered that the dance was progressive, it was necessary to continuously 
walk around the room, counter clock wise without disturbing anyone around us 
and do a figure when space and circumstance allowed it.

At this point in the travel of tango discovery we started to learn and 
practice 'close embrace'. Once we mastered this technique and form of 
dancing we were finally able to dance in the milongas of B.A. :))

Some of us also continued exploring and discovering the possibilities of 
'Open Style' tango.

Some of us discovered Nuevo Tango and felt it was exciting to learn a new 
way of doing things.
We particularly liked the sorpresive element of many of its moves.

But it was obvious that if we arrived at a crowded milonga we could only 
dance close embrace.

So we had to arrive early or stay late to be able to dance open, when more 
space was available.

The mood (as Derik describes) changes after most people leave by 4 am and 
there is more space to dance. The music changes, it could be more Pugliese, 
more Piazzola, More Raul Garello, more alternative music, synthetized music, 
etc.  The dancers open the embrace and they start flying around the room in 
a magical way, like in a ballet throwing  ganchos, amagues, heel sacadas, 
linear boleos, etc, without bothering each other. As I said it can look like 
a choreographed ballet.

This last group will continue to take lessons in open and/or nuevo, go to 
practicas and organize their own milongas.

Many milongas could occur at Sunderland in Villa Urquiza when there is room 
to dance, or &quot;La Marshall&quot; (gay milonga) on wednesdays. Or certain areas of 
certain milongas such as 'La viruta&quot; upstairs.

Outside B.A. most people dance Salon open or close embrace, again depending 
on the space available.  I dance a lot in Mar del Plata where most people 
like to dance salon open or close.

At &quot;La Rada&quot; they dance Nuevo Tango. Mar del Plata has a large group of 
Nuevo Tango dancers.

But where you can dance open embrace or nuevo tango is in the USA. There is 
plenty of space here
to dance in any way you wish. Milongas are not as crowded as in B.A. (of 
course there are exceptions ).  So if you prefer open embrace or Nuevo Tango 
by all means continue to dance that way. after all you dance 50 weeks a year 
in the USA and only two weeks in B.A.
I find absurd that people would dance close embrace because that is the way 
people in B.A. are forced to do.   Dance close embrace only if this is your 
preference.

Summary:  Most people dance salon close embrace. You have to look for the 
place and the oportunity to do the other styles. Dance anyway you like.

The learning sequencial process for many of us was: Salon open embrace, 
salon close embrace, milonguero close embrace, Nuevo tango, Canyengue.

For others has been:  Salon close embrace (they remained there).

                              Salon milonguero (they remained there).

                              Salon open, close, Nuevo. (they remained 
there).

                             Salon close, Canyengue. They are still learning 
this last form.

Some are starting to amalgamate taking elements from different styles.

We all continue to learn.

I hope that this helps to clarify this matter. Remember that this is my 
opinion according to my own experience but other people may have different 
ideas and they are welcome.

Best regards, Sergio.
