<pre>  That's all I can stand. I can't stands no more. 
  Enough already with this distinction between &quot;Teachers&quot; and &quot;wanna be teachers&quot;. 
  I say if someone is willing to share their knowledge with you, maybe you could learn what you can from them. 
  It seems to me that most everyone who calls themselves a &quot;teacher&quot; of tango has, one way or another, appointed themselves as a &quot;Teacher&quot;. 
  Who exactly, pray tell, decides who is a teacher of tango? 
  Although I have had one (count 'em, one) woman walk away because &quot;you aren't supposed to teach on the dance floor&quot;, and have had others let me know either verbally or non-verbally that they weren't open to input, the majority of women who have started to do tango more recently than I have are thankful that someone is willing to explain things to them. And, oddly enough, at the not tango dance venues I frequent, the number of women that are willing to accept input is much higher. There is a selection process going on there of course. Not coincidently, at those other places people aren?t constantly told to beware of people who &quot;want to be teachers&quot;. 
  When people share information freely, both misinformation and information is exchanged. So be it. I routinely share the names of those I think are good at teaching with those who seem truly interested in learning, and I certainly hope that people will do &quot;fact checking&quot; regarding what I tell them. 
  It took me into my 30's to know with certainty that all knowledge doesn't come from those we agree to call &quot;teacher&quot; or &quot;professor&quot;. I'm not going back.
  And, oh by the way, just last Sunday two different women I dance with shared with me what was basically the same helpful tip. I welcomed this input, and plan to start using it. Were they &quot;teaching&quot;? Call it what you want. Just don't denigrate it.
  Sometimes &quot;the rules&quot; are counter productive.
