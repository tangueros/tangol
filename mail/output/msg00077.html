<pre>Dear Tine:

So now you too have appointed yourself the
spokesperson and Representative for all 1200 people on
this list.  Your buddy, Michael Figart did that
already, twice..lol.

When are you &quot;close embrace all the time&quot; people going
to leave everybody alone and just let them dance the
way they want to without trying to teach them your
stuff and turn them into tango robots.  I am so tired
of all this &quot;parental control&quot; and ignorance.  You
guys need to learn instead of teach.  My opinion.

&gt; I am truly amazed that 1200 peple on this list let
&gt; this idiot Derik call them ignorant, incompetent,
&gt; dull, predictable, inexperienced, same old, boring,
&gt; BS. This is just the words from this email. You let
&gt; him do this not just once, but over and over again.
&gt; For years! Incredible. Mind-boggling!
&gt;    
&gt;   That's another idiot from Texas that you let walk
&gt; all over you. At least the other one, you elected
&gt; him, and you know he's not going to be there
&gt; forever.
&gt;    
&gt;   Don't any of you have any b*lls on you? (well a
&gt; few of you do) What's the matter with you? 
&gt;    
&gt;   You must all be confusing freedom of speech with
&gt; the right to be insulted. If people have nothing
&gt; interesting to contribute, they should not have
&gt; privileged access to 1200 inboxes. Is this Derik's
&gt; list, or everybody's list.

&gt;   Dear Michael:
&gt; 
&gt; Why does it not surprise me that you have never
&gt; heard
&gt; of the expression.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;I've never heard &quot;The embrace opens and closes like
&gt; a bandondeon.&quot;&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; This is the kind of ignorance that I am talking
&gt; about.
&gt; Furthermore, I do dance close embrace 60 to 80
&gt; percent of the time, so please do not tell me that I
&gt; have never experienced &quot;close embrace all the time&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I have!
&gt; 
&gt; Like you, I feel her heart pounding, but I also know
&gt; when she wants some space to express herself. Of
&gt; course to do this, she would have to know how to
&gt; dance...lol. This is the big problem with &quot;close
&gt; embrace all the time&quot; followers, who have not really
&gt; learned the entire dance. They are stuck with no
&gt; ideas for open, so they have to avoid it.
&gt; 
&gt; Doing one thing all the time is way too much.
&gt; Variety
&gt; is the spice of life.
&gt; 
&gt; PS- I can always tell when the &quot;close embrace all
&gt; the
&gt; time people&quot; arrive in a room to dance. The music
&gt; the
&gt; DJ plays suddenly becomes very predictable and
&gt; cutsie
&gt; stuff... rather dull. When &quot;the parents&quot; go home,
&gt; then the music then changes again and becomes more
&gt; lively.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess I just get tired of all the predictability,
&gt; the cutsie same old repetitious choreography. and
&gt; the
&gt; &quot;gee, look how cute we are&quot; mentality....and the
&gt; constant recruitment of inexperienced teachers and
&gt; students to teach this boring stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; I like to see more real energy on the dance floor. 
&gt; where people really know how to navigate the floor
&gt; in
&gt; complex patterns, follow the changes in the music,
&gt; and
&gt; &quot;move&quot; instead of just going through the motions. My
&gt; opinion.
&gt; 
&gt; Other than that, have a beautiful day in Washington.
&gt; 
&gt; Weather here is beautiful too, and I am going to
&gt; enjoy
&gt; it as well. Happy Spring.

&gt; &gt; I'd love to give you a break! Your arrogance is
&gt; only
&gt; &gt; exceeded by your ignorance of close embrace.
&gt; &gt; Changing the embrace? Why would I want to do that?
&gt; &gt; The embrace is like two batteries in a flashlight.
&gt; &gt; If they aren't in contact (facing the correct
&gt; &gt; direction), the light doesn't come on. To dance
&gt; open
&gt; &gt; would break the circuit between the batteries. I
&gt; &gt; don't want to break the circuit with my partner. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've never heard &quot;The embrace opens and closes
&gt; like
&gt; &gt; a bandondeon.&quot; WRONG!! My heart opens and closes
&gt; &gt; like a bandeneon, not the embrace. Sometimes I can
&gt; &gt; also feel her heart pounding. I may have to
&gt; slightly
&gt; &gt; adjust the embrace to allow the woman more room
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; a figure, but there's NO good reason to go from
&gt; &gt; close to open. If couples have to go to open for a
&gt; &gt; figure, it's probably a show tango figure, not
&gt; &gt; appropriate to the social floor. Or one, if not
&gt; &gt; both, partners are so stiff they can't dance close
&gt; &gt; because their stiff arms prevents them from
&gt; getting
&gt; &gt; close.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thank goodness it's a beautiful spring day in
&gt; &gt; Washington and I'm going out to enjoy it instead
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; reading Derek's posts.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Michael Ditkoff
&gt; &gt; Washington, DC
&gt; &gt; I'd rather be dancing Argentine Tango
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Looking forward to my next trip to NY to dance
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; N. and O. I thought I knew close embrace. These
&gt; &gt; women dance closer embrace.
&gt; &gt; Derek unfortunately wrote:
&gt; &gt; I do front ochos all the in variations of close
&gt; &gt; and open embrace. As you have heard it said many
&gt; &gt; times, &quot;The embrace
&gt; &gt; opens and closes like a bandondeon.&quot; My point is
&gt; &gt; to vary the embrace. You should know how to be
&gt; &gt; connected
&gt; &gt; with your partner, no matter what. Keeping the
&gt; &gt; embrace closed all the time is like
&gt; &gt; keeping the bandondeon closed all the
&gt; &gt; time...ridiculous! My view is that the
&gt; inexperience
&gt; &gt; and lack of understanding probably falls more on
&gt; &gt; the side of the people who do close embrace all
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; time,
&gt; &gt; and their teachers who purposely eliminate
&gt; &gt; teaching the front ocho entirely....like Tine.
&gt; Give
&gt; &gt; me a
&gt; &gt; break....lol.
