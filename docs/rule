%h2 What are these lists?
%p
  The Tango-L and Tango-A lists are the longest-running international Internet
  mailing lists related to the Argentine Tango. Tango-L is a discussion list for
  discussion of any aspect of the Argentine Tango and Tango-A is an announcement
  list for major Tango events worldwide. Tango-L was founded in 1995 and Tango-A
  was created in 1999 to separate the (largely non-commercial) discussions on
  Tango-L from announcements of events by their organizers on Tango-A. They have
  played a significant role in making the Tango world smaller.
%p
  Membership is open to anyone. The list is unmoderated, although conformance
  to the
  %a{:href => "#Rules"} list rules and policies
  (mostly common sense and a
  restatement of netiquette) is expected and enforced where necessary as list
  administrator time permits. Membership in each list is about 1000, and posting
  volume varies between 5 and 25 messages per day (a daily digest is available for
  those who prefer their Tango in fewer but larger doses).
%p
  Tango-L and Tango-A are complementary lists and most subscribers choose to
  subscribe to both. Tango-L is interactive and often opinionated and more like a
  discussion forum. Tango-A is for announcements--while any member can post there,
  postings are typically announcements made by event organizers or occasionally
  queries by travellers seeking Tango in various parts of the world that they may
  be travelling to. Tango-A has a "topics" option that allows subscribers to
  receive postings limited to their geographical area of interest, but again most
  subscribers choose to receive all (presumably because they have an interest in
  knowing what's going in elsewhere in the Tango world).
  
  
///////////////////////////////////////////////////
/ Subscribe  
%a{:name => "Subscribe"}>
%h2 Subscribing and Unsubscribing
%p
  You can
  %b subscribe
  to the list in one of two ways (Tango-L and Tango-A
  are independent as far as the list management 
  software is concerned and need to be subscribed to 
  individually):
%ul
  %li
    %b Recommended.
    Visit the list website at
    %a{:href => "http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-L"}
      http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-L
    (for Tango-L) or
    %a{:href => "http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-A"}
      http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-A
    (for Tango-A) and follow the instructions. 
    Basically, you enter your e-mail address and full 
    name, and you may also choose a password (or be 
    assigned one) for later administration
    of your membership. 
    You can also choose whether you want to receive 
    messages individually as they are posted, 
    or have them compiled in a daily "digest" and
    mailed to you once a day.
  %li      
    Alternatively, you may subscribe the old-fashioned way by sending an
    e-mail message to
    %b
      %a{:href => "mailto:Tango-L-request@mit.edu?subject=subscribe"}
        Tango-L-request@mit.edu
    or
    %b
      %a{:href => "mailto:Tango-A-request@mit.edu?subject=subscribe"}
        Tango-A-request@mit.edu
    with the word
    %b
      %i subscribe
    in the
    subject field or the body of the e-mail. There are many other command-line
    messages with a plethora of options for the nostalgic amongst us who prefer
    them to the web interfaces (where you can of course achieve the same thing).
    Send the command
    %i
      %b help
    to the
    %i -request
    address above to get a complete
    list.
        
%p
  You can
  %b unsubscribe
  to the list in one of two ways as well (Tango-L
  and Tango-A are independent and need to be unsubscribed from individually)::
%ul
  %li
    %b Recommended.
    Visit the list website at
    %a{:href => "http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-L"}
      http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-L
    (for Tango-L) or
    %a{:href => "http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-A"}
      http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-A
    (for Tango-A) and follow
    the instructions. If you have forgotten your password (which you will need,
    along with your e-mail address, to unsubscribe), there is an option for having
    it e-mailed to you.
  %li  
    Alternatively, you may send an e-mail message to
    %b
      %a{:href => "mailto:Tango-L-request@mit.edu?subject=unsubscribe"}
        Tango-L-request@mit.edu
    or
    %b
      %a{:href => "mailto:Tango-A-request@mit.edu?subject=unsubscribe"}
        Tango-A-request@mit.edu
    with the word
    %b
      %i unsubscribe
    in the
    subject field or the body of the e-mail.

%p
  In either case, there are options to unsubscribe an e-mail address other than
  the one you are sending the e-mail from, if you know the password or have access
  to that e-mail account.

/ Rules
%a{:name => "Rules"}>
%h2 List Rules, Policies and Guidelines
%p
  %b
    Personal attacks of individuals (also called
    %i ad hominem
    attacks) have proven to be the most disruptive, 
    with many subscribers leaving the list as a result. 
    Hence, violators of this rule are subject to 
    removal without notice.
%p
  The usage rules below for the Tango-L list have basically remained unchanged
  since 1995, when the list was created, except for edits in 1999 to reflect the
  formation of Tango-A, and minor clarifications and formatting modifications
  since then. Owing to limited administrator bandwidth, these rules are
  not always or uniformly enforced;
  %i however, they continue to be in effect
  . Even aside for the violation of the "no personal attacks" 
  rule stated above, repeated or intentional abusers of 
  %i any
  of the rules may be removed
  without notice. (Limited time availability by the volunteer administrators does
  not allow them to the luxury of enforcing all the rules, nor of handholding the
  most flagrant abusers.)

%a{:name => "Post"}
%h2 How to Post to the List
%p
  You have to be a member of the list to post to it. Once you are a member, send
  e-mail to
  %a{:href => "mailto:tango-L@mit.edu"} tango-L@mit.edu
  to post to
  Tango-L, and to
  %a{:href => "mailto:tango-A@mit.edu"} tango-A@mit.edu
  to post to
  Tango-A. Note that the list address (Tango-L@mit.edu or Tango-A@mit.edu)
  %i must
  be in the To: or Cc: field of your email, i.e., "Blind Carbon Copies" are not
  allowed. Also, the Tango-A list requires that the Subject line start with a
  geographical prefix (SA, NA-E:, NA-C:, NA-W:, EU-E:, EU-W:, AASP: or MISC:)
  otherwise it will not be distributed properly. Make sure you read the
  %a{:href => "#Rules"} Tango-L and Tango-A rules
  for detailed instructions before
  posting.
%p
  The list accepts only plaintext (non-HTML) mail and, for protection against
  viruses, etc., and to keep the size of the e-mails and archives manageable, no
  attachments either. You may feel free to provide links in your e-mail postings
  to web sites with relevant photos, etc. If you send HTML mail, it may be held
  owing to its size being too large, or it may be automatically reformatted into
  plaintext with unpredictable results.

/ Archives
%a{:name => "Archives"}>
%h2 List Archives 
%p
  The Tango-L and Tango-A lists have been archived by Lucy Lynch at
  %a{:href => "http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/index.html"}
    http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/index.html
  and
  %a{:href => "http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-A/index.html"}
    http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-A/index.html
  respectively, since
  2001, and it is expected that this will continue even with the existence of the
  Mailman archives (see below). This archive is accessible to anyone.
%p
  In addition, however, the Mailman software also provides for automatic
  archiving of lists hosted by Mailman. Since the Tango-L and Tango-A lists were
  moved to the Mailman software (from Listserv, where they were hosted from 1995)
  in April 2006, the Mailman archives exist only from May 2006 onwards. These archives may be found at
  %a{:href => "http://mailman.mit.edu/pipermail/tango-l/"}
    http://mailman.mit.edu/pipermail/tango-l/
  and
  %a{:href => "http://mailman.mit.edu/pipermail/tango-a/"}
    http://mailman.mit.edu/pipermail/tango-a/
  respectively, and are also
  publicly accessible. If you can't find them there, go to the main list homepage
  at
  %a{:href => "http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-l"}
    http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-l
  or
  %a{:href => "http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-a"}
    http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/tango-a
  and there will be a link to
  the list archives at the top.
