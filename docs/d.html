<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">The Transition to Mailman from Listserv<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p><i><font size="2">Last revised 25 April 2006 by Shahrukh Merchant</font></i></p>
<p>The <b>Tango-L</b> and <b>Tango-A</b> mailing lists have been hosted by MIT 
for over 10 years, using the Listserv software on the mitvma.mit.edu host. A 
couple of years ago, Information Services at MIT began a transition to the 
Mailman list management software, and now it is the turn of the Tango-L and 
Tango-A lists to make the transition.</p>
<p>If you were a member of the Tango-L or Tango-A list hosted on mitvma.mit.edu 
before about 26 April 2006, your subscription will be moved automatically to the 
new software, and the change will be mostly transparent to you. However, there 
are several things different about the new software and the user interface, 
which this page addresses.</p>
<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Changes Under Mailman<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>Unsubscribing or Changing Options.</b> You no longer need to send 
  e-mail to <i>listserv@mitvma.mit.edu</i> (that address is obsolete). New 
  instructions for subscribing and unsubscribing, changing your subscription 
  options, etc., are provided on the <a href="index.htm">Tango-L home page</a>. 
  Everything can be done from a web-based interface if you prefer, and there is 
  a lot more customization that you can do. For most people, that should make 
  the process a lot easier.</li>
  <li><b>Receiving Mail from the List.</b> Your subscription will have been 
  ported automatically to the new software, so you should automatically start 
  receiving mail. If you had spam filters in place that was set to allow mail 
  from the list based on headers that existed in received mail based on the 
  Listserv software, you will probably need to change them. The easiest way to 
  do this is to note that all legitimate mail from the list will have the list 
  address in the <i>To:</i> field of the message (whether you are getting 
  individual e-mails or digests).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>To: tango-L@mit.edu&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><i>or</i><b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To: tango-A@mit.edu<br>
  </b>(Note that <i>mitvma</i> is no longer in the list address.)</li>
  <li><b>Sending Mail to the List (Posting to the List).</b> Use the address <b>
  Tango-L@mit.edu</b> or <b>Tango-A@mit.edu</b> respectively (if you forget and 
  use mitvma.mit.edu out of habit, it will still reach for a short while since 
  the addresses will get forwarded, but this forwarding will disappear after a 
  while so you might as well get into the habit of changing to the new address, 
  updating your address book, etc.).</li>
  <li><b>Reaching a Real Person.</b> The address to reach the administrator(s) 
  is now <b>Tango-L-owner@mit.edu</b> (Tango-A-owner@mit.edu will also work but 
  will reach the same person).</li>
  <li><b>List Password.</b> You will be assigned a password for your 
  subscription, which will be e-mailed to you automatically periodically, or you 
  can have it e-mailed to you on request. You may use it to edit your 
  subscription settings on the web. There will be just one password for both 
  Tango-L and Tango-A (since they are hosted on the same server) if you are 
  subscribed to both lists under the same e-mail address.</li>
  <li><b>Topics for Tango-A.</b> Topics work slightly differently under Mailman 
  and this may need some fine-tuning. You may receive e-mail from more topics 
  than you subcribed to until this fine-tuning is complete. Also, it may not be 
  possible to specify more than one topic (which is consistent with Tango-A's 
  use of topics, although it was abused by some posters who specified multiple 
  topics).</li>
</ol>
<p>Really, that's it. Everything else is done for you. If you had Topics set on 
your Tango-A subscription, those topic names and individual settings have 
already been moved over for you, as has your other settings such as Digest, 
Nomail, etc. There are some more subtle issues that may not affect your 
individual subscription but the list as a whole, so I have collected those 
issues as a FAQ (which also addresses some questions that people have asked 
about the transition). Read on if you are interested!</p>
<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Frequently Asked Questions about the Transition to Mailman<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666"><i>How will the rest of the world find out about this change?</i><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>This is a very good question. Tango-L has been around for more than 10 years, 
when Internet mailing lists were still something of a novelty, and this very 
&quot;seniority&quot; makes it so useful (if it were being created now, on yahoogroups, 
for example, it would get lost in the sea of other speciality Tango lists). This 
means that there are innumerable links all over the Internet with instructions 
on how to subscribe to Tango-L and Tango-A and it is unrealistic to hope that 
all of these are going to be corrected in a few days (or at all). So many 
potential new subscribers could be lost.</p>
<p>This has been largely addressed in the following ways<i> (but you can 
help--see below!)</i>:</p>

  address.&quot; I am currently negotiating with the MIT Information Services staff 
  to set it up a little differently, so that it gives a more detailed 
  explanatory message saying that the list has moved and giving new instructions 
  (perhaps just a pointer to this site). This is a short-term fix since this 
  will disappear once the Listserv software is finally uninstalled, but at least 
  it will catch the near-term misdirections.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666"><i><b>How can I help?</b></i><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>The real problem is all those web sites out there that have instructions for 
subscribing to Tango-L and Tango-A, and which are now obsolete. I did a Google 
search on +&quot;tango-L&quot; +&quot;mitvma.mit.edu&quot; (which should catch all references to the 
old subscription information for this list) and <i><b>there are a reasonable 
number of 69 
matches</b></i>. If someone is willing to volunteer to contact all these website 
owners, followup methodically after a week, get them to change the information, 
etc., that will essentially solve the problem rapidly. Ultimately, I will do 
this myself, but after focussing on making the transition itself go smoothly, 
and with near-term travel plans, I cannot do this follow-up until much later 
than the optimal time (now) to do so.</p>
<p>If you are willing to help, please contact me first, just to make sure that 
these webmasters don't get mail-bombed with many people all trying to be helpful 
at the same time! Here is sample text to suggest they may use:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><b>Tango-L</b> and <b>Tango-A</b> are two worldwide Internet mailing lists 
for the Argentine Tango that anyone may subscribe to. <b>Tango-L</b> is for 
discussion about any aspect of Tango, and <b>Tango-A</b> is for announcements of 
major Tango events by region. Please go to <u><b>www.Tango-L.com</b></u> for 
details about these lists, how to subscribe, list policies, etc.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666"><i>What about archiving? Will that change?</i><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>Well, there is some good news here! The Tango-L and Tango-A lists are 
currently being archived by Lucy Lynch at
<a href="http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/index.html">
http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/index.html</a> and
<a href="http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-A/index.html">
http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-A/index.html</a> respectively. I expect 
that this will not change, since the archive feeds will continue automatically 
(though she may need to make some minor changes in the scripts).</p>
<p>In addition, however, the Mailman software also provides for automatic 
archiving of lists hosted by Mailman (although of course these Mailman archives 
will only start from May 2006 or so). It is always good to have redundancy of 
archives! See the <a href="index.htm">Tango-L home page</a> for information on 
accessing these archives.</p>
