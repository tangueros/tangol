2007.<br>
Clarification on &quot;Reviews (permitted) vs. Personal attacks (not permitted)&quot; and 
&quot;Privacy Policy&quot; added 6 April 2007. Further clarification and edits (in green) 
July/August 2008.<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<p><b>Note:</b> These rules <i>supplement</i> Netiquette, the generally 
established rules governing acceptable behaviour on the Internet. I.e., members 
of this list are still expected to have read and to follow those guidelines. 
They may be obtained from a number of Internet souces, including
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1855.txt">RFC1855 at IETF</a> 
or <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netiquette">Wikipedia</a>. 
While the rules have been stable for many years, constructive suggestions for 
improving are welcomed and may be sent to tango-L-owner [@] mit.edu (specific 
suggestions and rewording are more useful than general or vague ones).</p>

&nbsp;</font></b><ol type="a">
    <li><b><a name="RELEVANCE-Tango"></a>Tango related only.</b>&nbsp; All 
    articles should be related to the Argentine Tango or a directly

on the merits or otherwise of a particular Tango technique, music,
style, etc., or even objective critique, positive or negative, of a
well-known Tango teacher, are perfectly appropriate; however, anything
that degenerates into personal attacks should be relegated to personal
e-mail. It is a strong preference of members of this list, as well as
its hosts, the list owners, that this sort of &quot;mean-spirited mood
[and] ... juvenile invective ... [that] has seeped into conversations on
[some] Internet newsgroups and other computer talk forums&quot;[1] NOT be
part of Tango-L. Besides, it is just plain boring to the 99% of list
members not involved in the hostilities. Accordingly, you may find less
tolerance from members of this list to violation of this rule than to
most of the others.

inasmuch as it is understood by a majority of list members. However,
articles may be posted in any language of the poster's choosing. Several postings appear in Spanish, and many of these are particularly
appreciated by list members, such as postings from Argentina or from
Spanish-speaking Tango authorities. Bilingual list members sometimes
voluntarily translate them into English. (Translations in the other
direction--from English to Spanish--have been rare, but are also
welcomed.) So if you can express yourself better in another language,
especially Spanish, you are welcomed to submit postings in that
language. If you request, at the top of your article, that it be
translated into English, it is quite likely that someone will do so.<br>

copyright. These opinions vary from (a) &quot;they are automatically in the
public domain&quot; (generally not considered supportable) to (b) &quot;the author
has absolute ownership with or without a copyright notice.&quot; The best
course is for people reading or using others' articles to assume that
original material posted to this list is fully protected by U.S. and
International Copyright laws and agreements, and that they are
responsible for knowing about and observing these laws. (Authors,
however, should not assume that this position will necessarily be
enforceable.)<br>

excerpting for reviews, summaries, etc., such as would be permitted

permitted, as long as the intent of the author is not distorted or
misrepresented. The outright copying of an article for
re-publication is almost always in violation of copyright statutes,
unless you have obtained the permission of the author first.
Publishers often use a &quot;300-word limit on works quoted without
permission&quot;[2] as a maximum excerpting allowance for large
works--although this sets a precedent, it is not part of the
Copyright laws, so adhering to it does not guarantee that you are
within the scope of &quot;Fair Use.&quot; In particular, it is unlikely to be
considered &quot;Fair Use&quot; for the sort of articles posted to Internet
mailing lists, where 300 words may well be a large fraction, if not
the entirety, of the work in question. It is suggested (but not
guaranteed to be &quot;Fair Use&quot;) that you use no more than 300 words
or 10%, whichever is SMALLER, on works quoted without permission
in non-electronic media, paid subscriptions, etc.

    without attachments only.</b>&nbsp; The list accepts only plaintext (non-HTML) mail and, for protection against 
viruses, etc., and to keep the size of the e-mails and archives manageable, no 
attachments either. You may feel free to provide links in your e-mail postings 
to web sites with relevant photos, etc. If you send HTML mail, it may be held

plaintext (with sometimes unpredictable results).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b><a name="FORMATTING-SubjectLine"></a>Use meaningful &quot;Subject:&quot; line.</b>&nbsp; 
    Make the &quot;Subject:&quot; field of your message as explicit a 1-line
description of the content of your message as you can. If you have a
&quot;digest&quot; subscription and are following up to a previous posting, copy
the exact contents of the original &quot;Subject:&quot; line (assuming it is an<br>
appropriate one for your follow-up), prepend the word &quot;re: &quot; and use
that as the &quot;Subject:&quot; for your followup. Do not simply use the digest 
    banner &quot;Tango-L Digest, Vol xx, Issue yy&quot; as the subject, even if
that is the one that your mail reader generates automatically.<br>

    responses are almost always junk mail, e.g., &quot;I agree!&quot; &quot;Yes, me [sic] too!&quot; 
    and the like. Either
add some more value by elaborating, or use personal e-mail to show 1-line
support (or lack of it) for someone's position. <font color="#008000">Similarly, 
    one-liner links to other websites (especially YouTube sites) should at least 
    be accompanied by some sort of brief explanation as to what is there, or why

    unfortunately seem to be doing) but that's not a good reason to do so.
People have read the previous article if they're interested in the subject, so you 
    generally don't need to quote
anything, or just the specific points you are addressing in your followup if is is <i>truly</i> necessary to provide context to and avoid 
    misinterpretation of your response.<br>

  <li><b><a name="COMMONSENSE-BeCourteous"></a>Be courteous.</b>&nbsp; As with 
  any community, it becomes a more pleasant place for us all if
some common courtesy is maintained. This means refraining from sarcasm
or attacks directed at other list members or groups, not demeaning other
contributors, being welcoming to new members (or new posters) of the
list, etc. Don't fall into the trap of letting the absence of
face-to-face interaction lure you into forgetting the cordiality you
would show if you met the person at a live event, práctica, etc.
Please also see the section of these rules on &quot;No flames.&quot;<br>

  <li><b><a name="COMMONSENSE-DontMonopolize"></a>Don't monopolize the list.</b>&nbsp; 
  Don't feel like you need to reply to
every posting on which you have an opinion, unless there is some
significant tango-related information you can add to it. So limit your
submissions to no more than 4 per week, unless there are extenuating
circumstances (such as daily &quot;field reports&quot; from a major week-long
Tango Congress that you're attending). (List support functions, such as
translations of articles posted by volunteer translators, or
administrative messages, do not count towards this limit.)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b><a name="COMMONSENSE-CulturalDifferences"></a>Be aware of cultural differences.</b>&nbsp; 
  There are innumerable cultures and cultural differences represented on
this list. Many may not be fluent in English (or whatever language
you're posting in), and the e-mail medium makes it difficult to
interpret true intent. Human communication is 85% non-verbal and 15%
verbal. Things can be said orally that, because of body language,
intonation, etc., take on a whole different meaning. In e-mail, the
only thing transmitted is what is written. &quot;Smileys&quot; and other attempts
at denoting emotions are a poor substitute and can themselves be
misinterpreted. The following rule will always stand you in good stead:<br>
<br>
  <i>&quot;Be generous in the interpretation of what you read, and sensitive
in your language in what you write.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;</i></li>
  <li><b><a name="COMMONSENSE-PrivateCorrespondence"></a>Don't post private correspondence
  <font color="#008000">or other private information</font> without the author's permission.</b>&nbsp; 
  Privately received correspondence should not be posted publically
without the consent of the author. This could be either private
e-mail, or even an article from a small or intimate private discussion
group whose members may expect a high degree of privacy in their
postings. <font color="#008000">Similarly, private information such as phone 
  numbers, addresses, emails, etc., if individuals should not be posted without 
  their consent.</font><br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b><a name="COMMONSENSE-CompileResponses"></a>Compile responses to your questions, and post back to the list.&nbsp;
  </b>When posting requests for information, ask for information to be sent
directly to you (rather than to the entire list) and offer to compile
the responses for posting to the entire list. Then do it!<br>

&nbsp;</b><ol type="a">
    <li><b><a name="COMMERCIAL-TangoA"></a>ALMOST ALL COMMERCIAL POSTINGS BELONG IN TANGO-A.&nbsp;
    </b>Virtually all commercial Tango-related postings are in fact
announcements, either of forthcoming events, e.g., workshops or
special events, or of sources for Tango materials (e.g., CDs).
These announcements are now permitted on Tango-A, subject to
the posting rules of Tango-A, which are much more liberal in
this regard than those of Tango-L prior to the existence of
Tango-A. As stated in Section 1(c), such announcements are
consequently no longer appropriate on Tango-L and should be posted
on Tango-A.<b><br>
&nbsp;</b></li>
    <li><b><a name="COMMERCIAL-Introduction"></a>1-time introductions of professionals or organizations are OK, with annual reintroduction (other postings to Tango-A).</b>&nbsp; 
    It is permitted to make a one-time introduction of oneself as a
Tango professional or a Tango organization (commercial, community or
non-profit) to the list membership, and this may be repeated no more
frequently than once a year. Note that this introduction should be
just that--information on specific events or classes should be sent to
Tango-A.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b><a name="COMMERCIAL-Unrelated"></a>Postings unrelated to Tango are explicitly prohibited.</b>&nbsp; 
    Postings that are not directly related to the Tango are explicitly
prohibited.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b><a name="COMMERCIAL-Reviews"></a>Disinterested 3rd-party reviews OK (if they are of local scope, they
should be go to Tango-A).</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reviews of teachers, etc., by 
    <i>disinterested</i> third parties
(whose only relationship is that of satisfied--or dissatisfied--customer) are not considered commercial postings, and are always
welcomed. If it is a review of a local event or a local teacher,
however, it should probably go as a follow-up to a posting to Tango-A.
(Such postings should include a statement of your lack of affiliation,
and that you weren't asked to make such a post.) See also 
    <a href="#RELEVANCE-NegativeReviews">Item 1(c) on <i>Negative reviews 
    permitted (with strict requirements)</i></a>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b><a name="COMMERCIAL-Signature"></a>Short affiliation on signature is 
    acceptable.</b>&nbsp; It is acceptable to include in your signature 2 
    additional lines that contain the name of your Tango-related business and a 
    website or email address of that business.<br>

  <li><b><a name="ABUSE"></a>List Abuse and Responses to Them<br>
&nbsp;</b><ol type="a">
    <li><b><a name="ABUSE-Spam"></a>Spam (obviously not permitted).</b>&nbsp; 
    Every once in a while, someone will post an advertisement to
all the mailing lists and/or newsgroups that he can possibly find (a
&quot;spam&quot;). Of course, this is unlikely to be related to the Tango and
since the poster rarely if ever subscribes to any of these lists, a rule
that says &quot;No spams&quot; is irrelevant. However, we state this rule anyway:
&quot;No spam and no advertising unrelated to the subject matter of the list.&quot;
(There are some built-in mechanisms to minimize the likelihood of most
    spam reaching the list members.)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b><a name="ABUSE-ChainLetters"></a>Chain letters (obviously not permitted).</b>&nbsp; 
    This is strictly forbidden by the
policies of the sponsoring institution (MIT), and includes any posting
that explicitly requests further distribution in a manner intended to
replicate in a chain reaction fashion beyond a particular discussion
group. The definition of a chain letter is not limited to those which
request money--Virus &quot;alerts,&quot; political petitions, attempts to
set world records for e-mail received and &quot;e-mail bomb&quot; requests are some
other examples of what would be considered a chain letter.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b><a name="ABUSE-Discussion"></a>NO DISCUSSION of list abuses on the list!</b>&nbsp;
Should someone abuse the list in any way, whether or not identified in
these rules, the most important rule is that NO followup note or
discussion of any kind about the abuse should be sent to the whole
list, as that just multiplies manifold the junk mail created by that<br>
spam. Appropriate responses are (in order of preference):<br>

&nbsp;</b></font><ol type="a">
    <li><b><a name="ENFORCEMENT-Monitoring"></a>Monitoring of subsequent postings.</b>&nbsp;
In most cases, violation of rules by a list member is unintentional and
only requires education of the offender as to proper usage. Less often,
it is a flagrant or repeated violation by someone who believes he is
above the rules. The list administrators will generally send an
explanatory note explaining the problem. In the case of repeated or
severe violations (intentional or otherwise) the list administrators
may screen all further postings to the list from the individual(s)
concerned until there is positive evidence that the problem has
abated, in order to protect the list and its membership.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b><a name="ENFORCEMENT-PrivateEmail"></a>PRIVATE e-mail by other list members (NOT to the entire list).</b>&nbsp; 
    If you believe someone has violated a rule, send the person a politely
worded message informing him or her of that, preferably with the
relevant portion of these rules attached. Do this by private e-mail
ONLY--do NOT chastise the person publically on the list as this leads to
the inevitable flame-war. This is NOT a suggestion to &quot;mail bomb&quot; the
person; rather, it is hoped that a large number of private reprimands
(especially in the case of intentional violations) will make it clear
that the behaviour was inappropriate. You may send a copy of that mail
to the administrators at <b>tango-L-owner@mit.edu</b> if you would
like to.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b><a name="ENFORCEMENT-Ask"></a>If you aren't sure, ask the list administrator.</b>&nbsp; 
    If you would like to submit an article that you think is marginal, you
are welcome to e-mail it first to the list administrator at <b>tango-L-owner@mit.edu</b> for an opinion. 
    Siumilarly, if you believe that someone is flagrantly or repeatedly violating the
list rules and the the administrators are not controlling this
properly, please forward the relevant messages to the administrators at <b>tango-L-owner@mit.edu</b> and they will consider the situation.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b><a name="ENFORCEMENT-Extreme"></a>In extreme cases ...</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is hoped that the above procedure will suffice. However, to protect
the list and its members, it is necessary to state that you may be
removed from the list, and/or kept from posting to it, under
circumstances including, but not limited to, the following: Extreme,
continued or intentional violation of the list guidelines and policies,
or of Internet usage conventions (as determined solely by the list
administrator or list owner, or person(s) designated by the list
administrator or list owner); violation of the acceptable use policies
of the sponsoring institution (MIT); violation of any applicable law,
including copyright law; any other action that, in the sole opinion of
the list administrator or list owner, or person(s) designated by the
list administrator or list owner, may be harmful to the list, its
members, or the computer or communications facilities or networks that
support it.</li>

    i.e., the list of members is not openly available. However, anyone posting 
    to the list has his or her email address publicized to all members of the 
    list, and potentially to the entire Internet by virtue of publically 
    accessible archives of this list. This may subject the list member to 
    unwanted email (&quot;spam&quot;) or similar abuse, over which the list administrators 
    have no control. Human error, on the part of the administrators or this list 
    or the computer systems that support it, may also inadvertently make the 
    contents of the membership available to a wider audience than intended.<br>

    Posters of articles to this list should not assume any privacy with respect
